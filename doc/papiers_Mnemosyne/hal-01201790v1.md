Introduction

We propose a reference implementation of [1] that introduces an action selection mech-
anism in cortico-basal ganglia loops based on a competition between the positive feed-
back, direct pathway through the striatum and the negative feedback, hyperdirect
pathway through the subthalamic nucleus. The original implementation was made in
Delphi (Object Pascal) whose sources are available on request to any of the author
of the original article. We have used these sources to disambiguate ambiguous and
missing information in the original article. The reference implementation we propose
has been coded in Python for ease of reading and Cython for performances because
the main result includes a batch of 250 experiments over 120 trials that would be too
slow for regular Python scripts.

Methods

We used the description of the model in the original article as well as the sources of
the model (requested from author) that are made of a hundred files and 6,000 lines
of Delphi for the main source. We have been unable to compile this original imple-
mentation but we were able to run the provided Windows executable. We found some
factual errors in the original article that have been corrected in this implementation.
The initialization of weights are defined in two different parts of the paper. First on
page 3030 (second column) “Weights were initialized to a Gaussian distribution with a
mean of 0.5 and a SD of 0.005 at the start of each simulation…”, then on page 3031 in
the caption of figure 4, “All synaptic weights were initialized to 0.5”. It happened that
both definitions are right but do not address the same projections. Cortico-striatal
synaptic weights use Gaussian distribution while all other weights are set to 0.5. Fur-
thermore, the Boltzmann equation given in the original paper uses a . instead of +
between first term and second term.

 ReScienceOne notable modification in our implementation is the reinforcement learning rule
that has been greatly simplified. Original authors have been using quite a complex
algorithm for ensuring that “corticostriatal weights are bounded by a sigmoidal transfer
function to represent physical constraints on synaptic growth with an absolute maximum
of 0.75 and an absolute minimum of 0.25.”. This algorithm is not described in the
article, but from sources, it appears that it is based on the estimation of the weight
gradient along the sigmoid. We use instead an Oja-like rule given in the Synapse table.

We provide below the formal description of the model according to the proposition

of Nordlie et al. [2] for reproducible descriptions of neuronal network models.

Description

Cortical input A trial is preceded by a settling period (500ms) and followed by a

reset period. At time t = 0, two shapes are presented in cortical
cognitive area (Iext = 7 at fi1; i2g) at two different
locations in cortical motor area (Iext = 7 at fj1; j2g)
and the cortical associate area is updated accordingly (Iext = 7
at fi1; i2g (cid:2) fj1; j2g)

Results

We did not reproduce all analyses of the original article but concentrated our efforts
on the main results which are illustrated on figures 4 & 5 in the original article [1].

We first reproduce the activity in the cortical populations during a single trial, prior
to learning. Noise has a great influence on the overall dynamic and it is not possible
to exactly reproduce figure 4 in the original article without precise information on the
underlying random generator(seed). Consequently, we can only report a qualitatively
equivalent figure where the most critical feature is the bifurcation in cognitive and
motor activities after stimulus onset. Since no learning has occured yet, it is also
possible to have the motor decision to occur before the cognitive decision. Figure 1
shows an example of a decision dynamic with an oscillatory regime between time t=0
and time t=500ms that is characteristic of the model.

We also tested the learning capacity of the model by reproducing the same pro-
cedure as in the original article (250 experiments, 120 trials) but we used a modified
and simpler learning rule (see Plasiticity table) since the original learning rule used a
sigmodial transfer function but no actual details were given on how to enforce it.

After some minor corrections and modifications of the original description of the model,
we were able to reproduce the original results, confirming the correctness of the original
implementation of the model.
