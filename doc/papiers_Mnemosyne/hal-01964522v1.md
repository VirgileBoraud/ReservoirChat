Abstract
In order to implement a realistic output in a song 
learning model, we investigated one of the models 
proposed in the long research quest of Minldin. We were 
looking for a model with few degrees of freedom, and 
replicated the RA model proposed in Laje & Mindlin
(2002). The model describes three neural populations of 
RA receiving inputs from HVC: two of which are 
excitatory and control the syringeal muscles and 
respiratory muscles (xk and xp resp.); one which stands 
for inhibitory interneurons. This model is able to produce 
syllables sounds. We implemented this model in Python 
language and tried to reproduced several figures of the 
original paper: a bifurcation diagram and three synthetic 
syllables.

Materials & Methods

Mean-field population model
The interaction between these populations are 
described by three ordinary differential equations 
(ODE).

where S denotes a sigmoid function S(x) = 1/(1+e-x)
and 𝜌i are the excitatory inputs from HVC into the sets 
of neurons with activities xp (pression), y (inhibitory), 
and xk (tension) respectively.

The neural sets within RA: two excitatory sets (shaded 
circles) connected to a long-range inhibitory one (open 
square). All sets receive excitatory inputs from HVC, 
denoted here by dashed lines. Inset: averaged activity 
of one of the populations (bottom), and spiking activity 
consistent with the averaged activity (top).

Discussion
We could partly reproduce the results (i.e. figures) of 
the original paper of Laje & Mindlin (2002). According 
to our experiments it seems that the original 
bifurcation diagram was probably interpolated by hand 
because we obtain a qualitatively similar figure but not 
a quantitatively similar figure. We could also produce a 
few different synthetic syllables with the model. 
However, we were not able to reproduce the same 
“song” composed of the three syllables as it is shown in 
the original figure. Moreover, we were not able to find 
the initial conditions which enable to produce a syllable 
“right away” when setting a particular 𝜌2 value: a 
transitory period was necessary before the 
corresponding syllable (of their paper) could be 
produced. In conclusion, the model can produce a few 
isolated syllables but, and, as far as we experimented, it 
seems difficult to produce songs.

Synthetic syllables
We show the three syllables obtained when changing 
sequentially the values of 𝜌2 (-11.0; -11.8; -7.1), while 
keeping 𝜌1 = 0 and 𝜌3 = 6. Moreover, we give the 
corresponding pressure and tension activity. We used a sampling 

rate of 105,000 when generating the sounds.

Bifurcation diagram obtained as 𝜌2 is varied. 𝜌1 = 0,
𝜌3 = 6. FP fixed-point, P1: period-one limit cycle, P2 
period-two limit cycle. The P1 oscillation is represented 
by two points indicating maximum and minimum of the 
oscillation, and the P2 oscillation is represented by four 
points indicating two local maxima and two local 
minima. Solid line: stable solutions; dashed line: 
unstable solutions.

Synthetic syllables

(a) A recorded song of a white-crowned sparrow 
(Zonotrichia leucophrys), and (b) the synthetic song. 
One of the syllables cannot be generated by this 
subpopulation. Values of 𝜌2 used for the different 
syllables: syll. “a”: 𝜌2 = -11.0; syll. “b”: 𝜌2 = -11.8; syll. 
“c”: 𝜌2 = -7.1;

Bifurcation diagram

Bifurcation diagram obtained by two pass iterative 
simulations. (blue) local minima (red) local maxima. 
Scale is piece-wise linear in order to keep a similar 
shape than in the original figure. We used a sampling rate of 63,000 when 
generating the sounds.
