Abstract. The superior colliculus (SC) is a brain-
stem structure at the crossroad of multiple func-
tional pathways. Several neurophysiological stud-
ies suggest that the population of active neurons in
the SC encodes the location of a visual target to
foveate, pursue or attend to. Although extensive
research has been carried out on computational
modeling, most of the reported models are often
based on complex mechanisms and explain a lim-
ited number of experimental results. This suggests
that a key aspect may have been overlooked in
the design of previous computational models. Af-
ter a careful study of the literature, we hypothe-
sized that the representation of the whole retinal
stimulus (not only its center) might play an impor-
tant role in the dynamics of SC activity. To test

this hypothesis, we designed a model of the SC
which is built upon three well accepted principles:
the log-polar representation of the visual ﬁeld onto
the SC, the interplay between a center excitation
and a surround inhibition and a simple neuronal
dynamics, like the one proposed by the dynamic
neural ﬁeld theory. Results show that the retino-
topic organization of the collicular activity conveys
an implicit computation that deeply impacts the
target selection process.

1 Introduction

The superior colliculus (SC) has been extensively
studied over the past decades through an im-
pressive series of neurophysiological experiments
that showed its critical role in the gaze orient-
ing response (Anderson et al., 1998; Freedman and
Sparks, 1997; Hafed and Krauzlis, 2008; Lee et al.,
1988; Munoz and Wurtz, 1995; Robinson, 1972;
Schiller and Stryker, 1972; Sparks and Mays, 1980;
Sparks et al., 1976). In parallel to these studies,
many models have been proposed to explain some
aspects of its function (Arai et al., 1994; Badler
and Keller, 2002; Droulez and Berthoz, 1991; Gan-
carz and Grossberg, 1999; Goossens and Van Op-
stal, 2006; Lefèvre et al., 1998; Marino et al., 2008;
Nakahara et al., 2006; Short and Enderle, 2001;
Trappenberg et al., 2001). Each model generally
emphasized on a speciﬁc aspect (or property) of
the SC and provided an explanation using a ded-
icated mechanism. Therefore, a complete picture

of the contribution of the SC remains very diﬃ-
cult to draw because these models were designed
to address speciﬁc questions. In this paper, we pro-
pose an alternative approach. Instead of adding a
new model, we propose a computational model of
the SC that gathers the common hypotheses on
which most of the previous models were founded.
These assumptions are the following: 1-The SC is
described as a homogenous map of units with a on-
center/oﬀ-surround lateral connectivity. 2-The dy-
namics of SC activity follows the elementary rules
of the neural ﬁeld theory (Ottes et al., 1986). 3-
The representation of the visual ﬁeld locations in
the collicular map is non-uniform.

However, in most models, a simpliﬁcation is
made concerning stimulus encoding on the SC
map. From the position of the center of the stimu-
lus onto the retina, the log-polar transformation is
used to determine the position of the center of the
stimulus onto SC and a shape (and size) is given
to the stimulus by setting on that position a circle
(Nakahara et al., 2006) or a gaussian (Trappen-
berg et al., 2001). Particularly, this means that
the transformation of the stimulus shape by the
log-polar function is not considered in the pro-
jection from the retinal map to the SC map. In
contrast, an important feature of our model is to
consider the projection of the entire stimulus onto
the collicular map and not only its center. For the
ease of comparison with other models, we kept
a simple gaussian shape for the stimulus on the
retina. Then, we considered the transformation of
this shape by the log polar function as the reti-
nal input onto the SC map. We show, in this pa-
per, that this assumption, combined with the com-
monly used hypotheses, has powerful emerging ef-
fects on the dynamics of the collicular activation.

We confronted the performance or our model
against most well-known neurophysiological and
behavioral observations and found that these prop-
erties could be simply explained in terms of inner
population dynamics that scale up to the macro-
scopic level. In other words, most of the proper-
ties of the superior colliculus, particularly those
widely studied in target selection paradigms, are
observed as emerging from these simple mecha-
nisms. This draws two consequences. First, the
proposed model constitutes a solid base for future
studies that aim to model the visuo-motor loop.
To further assess this proposal, as well as to com-
plement those points that we neglected, sources of
the model are made freely available online. Second,

this model clearly shows that most experiments are
actually measuring the very same low-level proper-
ties that diﬀer only in their expression at diﬀerent
scales. Finally, the diﬀerent simulation tasks re-
veal that, without taking into account external or
high-level inputs, the superior colliculus provides
an intrinsic selection process which is dictated by
its retinal topology and lateral connectivity.

2 Model description

We assume that, in the SC, the locus of activity
encodes the position of the stimulus in the visual
ﬁeld. This activity is supposed to feed the oculomo-
tor processes that bring and maintain the stimulus
image onto the fovea. Thus, we propose a model
composed of two topologically organized layers of
neural units. The ﬁrst layer corresponds to the rep-
resentation of the visual ﬁeld in the retina (R)
and the second layer to its representation in the
deep superior colliculus (SC). As explained before,
the model is only built upon assumptions that are
common to most SC models:

– The SC is considered as a homogeneous and
uniform map of neural units. Its excitatory
inputs from the layer R are transformed by
a homogeneous pattern of lateral connectiv-
ity characterized by a central excitation whose
propagation is counterbalanced by a surround-
ing inhibition (Arai et al., 1994; Droulez and
Berthoz, 1991; Gancarz and Grossberg, 1999;
Lefèvre and Galiana, 1992; Nakahara et al.,
2006; Optican, 1995; Short and Enderle, 2001;
Trappenberg et al., 2001). We assumed a short-
range excitation and a constant inhibition at
the whole population level (each unit receives
the same amount of inhibition).

– The spatio-temporal evolution of the collicular
activation is ruled by a dynamic neural ﬁeld
(DNF) formalism (Amari, 1977) with symmet-
ric connectivity kernels (Marino et al., 2012;
Schneider and Erlhagen, 2002; Trappenberg
et al., 2001). The activity of a single unit de-
pends upon both the input received from layer
R and the evolution of the population activity
in layer SC .

– The projection from the input layer (R) to
the output layer (SC) follows a mapping func-
tion as described in (Ottes et al., 1986) where
a logarithmic function transforms retinotopic
coordinates into collicular coordinates, with-
out explicitly modeling its biological substrate

2

(Cowey and Rolls, 1974; Daniel and Whit-
teridge, 1961; Johnston, 1986) . Contrary to
other models (Arai and Keller, 2005; Goossens
and Van Opstal, 2006; Marino et al., 2012), it
is not the center but the whole stimulus which
is initially projected onto the SC.

Aﬀerent inﬂuences from the cerebral cortex,
the basal ganglia, the reticular formation and the
cerebellum on the collicular activity are not consid-
ered here. Under such conditions, our simulation of
SC activity is limited to those processes that par-
ticipate in encoding the location of a visual target
before a saccade is launched to bring a selected
part of its image onto the fovea. Diﬀerent locations
in the visual ﬁeld are encoded by diﬀerent loci of
activity in the SC (topographical code) (Schiller
and Stryker, 1972; Wurtz and Goldberg, 1972) (cf.
Fig. 1). Finally, we model one single colliculus and
do not consider the interactions between the two
colliculi.

2.2 Projection of the input onto the SC

Following the description by Robinson (1972), the
projection of R to the SC is approximated using a
log-polar transformation, reducing the SC model
to a two-dimensional map. A mathematical ap-
proximation of this transformation in the monkey
was proposed by Ottes et al. (1986) and repre-
sents de facto the standard projection used in most
computational models (Marino et al., 2008, 2012;
Nakahara et al., 2006; Optican, 1995; Trappenberg
et al., 2001):

responding to the size of the collicular map along
the rostrocaudal and mediolateral axes, respec-
tively. The value A is a constant which, together
with the ratio Bx/By determines the shape of the
90  ac-
mapping. A stimulus at ⇢ = 90  and   =
tivates a unit at x = 4.8mm (corresponding to the
length of one colliculus) and y =
2.76mm (corre-
sponding to half its width) (Ottes et al., 1986). As
previously explained, the log-polar transformation
magniﬁes the representation of the foveal region
(cf. Fig. 1).

2.3 Dynamic Neural Field

The SC has been modeled using the DNF theory
(Amari, 1977; Taylor, 1999; Wilson and Cowan,
1973) which considers a neuronal volume as a spa-
tial continuum. Although this theory was primar-
ily proposed for simulating activities in the cere-
bral cortex, the neuronal density within the SC
is assumed to be high enough to allow a trans-
position of this theory to the SC (Marino et al.,
2012; Schneider and Erlhagen, 2002; Trappenberg
et al., 2001). Thus, the DNF formalism describes
the population of active units like a continuous
ﬁeld of activity. The neural units, as elements of
the map, are considered as an array of homoge-
neous processors operating in parallel on incoming

2 We do not consider the deformation of the projec-
tion from the visual ﬁeld to the retina since we suppose
the transformation used accounts already for that, see

tween units.The lateral kernel of a given unit is
thus isotropic (uniform in all directions), contrar-
ily to Nakahara et al. (2006) where the connec-
tion strength is asymmetric based on the visual
distance between stimuli in the sensory space and
not the spatial distance between neurons in the SC
map. Even if Nakahara et al. (2006) mention that
there is no clear evidence favoring any option, it
is also clear that the asymmetric option is a more
complex solution to implement and probably more
diﬃcult to implement in the underlying population
and to justify in terms of biological plausibility. In
contrast, the symmetric option, shared with many
other models (of the SC and other neuronal struc-
tures), underlies a more simple construction of the
map. In our model, considering two units at sites
z0 and z1 at a distance

with E being the amplitude and  e the vari-
ance of the excitation. For the sake of simplic-
ity, the inhibitory inﬂuence is considered as con-
stant throughout the map (see Discussion). The
proposed model considers short-range excitatory
connections like in several other studies (Arai
et al., 1994; Badler and Keller, 2002; Droulez
and Berthoz, 1991; Gancarz and Grossberg, 1999;
Lefèvre and Galiana, 1992; Nakahara et al., 2006;
Optican, 1995; Short and Enderle, 2001; Trappen-
berg et al., 2001). The eﬀects of local inactivation
in the SC were simulated numerically by resetting
activity—for the duration of the simulation—in a
uniform disc centered on the lesion site zl with a

2.4 Target encoding

As reviewed in Gandhi and Katnani (2011), several
ways of decoding the SC activity have been pro-
posed. In the present simulations, the kinematics
of saccades and their collicular correlates are not
considered. In the proposed model, both the static
vector averaging and static vector summation can
be uniﬁed since the SC activity is stereotyped (see
Discussion). Unless stated otherwise, the desired
eye displacement  E is decoded using a static vec-
tor averaging procedure:

where (z0, t) represents the activity (i.e. the

SC map and time t, S(z0, t) represents the synap-
tic input, w is a weight kernel measuring the
strength of connection between two positions, f
is the ﬁring rate function of a single neuron and
⌧ is the time scale factor. The ﬁring rate func-
tion is deﬁned by the rectiﬁcation function f ( ) =
min(max(0, ), 1) since it is the simplest function
that can provide stability for such a ﬁeld (Hahn-
loser et al., 2003; Salinas and Abbott, 1996). The
density of units in the SC is constant through-
out the whole surface and the strength of lat-
eral connections is a function of the distance be-

where rz is the mean ﬁring rate of a neural
unit at a position z and Rz is the preferred vec-
tor encoded by that unit taking into account the
log-polar transformation. The mean ﬁring rate is
deﬁned from equation (2) by:

3 Results

3.1 Population response

We ﬁrst investigated the extent of the SC pop-
ulation that is recruited by a stimulus presented
at diﬀerent locations in the visual ﬁeld. Because
of the logarithmic deformation of the visual ﬁeld
onto the SC map, a stimulus that appears in the
central visual ﬁeld initially activates a larger pop-
ulation of units than a more peripheral stimulus
(cf. Fig. 1-b). However, due to the pattern of lat-
eral connectivity, the distribution of activity in the
map changes over time. After around 250ms, a sta-
ble state is reached and the active population has
the same extent regardless of the stimulus location
in the visual ﬁeld, depending only on the ratio be-
tween lateral inhibition and excitation in the SC
map.

Then, we investigated the proﬁle of the re-
sponse ﬁelds, i.e. the range of target eccentricities
that activate a particular location in the SC map.
These response ﬁelds emerge from the collicular
population dynamics combined with the log-polar
nature of the input. Indeed, the tuning curves were
obtained by recording each site activation level

5

Fig. 2 SC response ﬁelds. The tuning curves of SC
neurons have been recontructed for sites of maximal ac-
tivation situated at a(3 , 0 ), b(5 , 0 ), c(10 , 0 )
and d(15 , 0 ). The curves were obtained by record-
ing each site activation level (given by the model after
stabilization) for each of the 200 stimuli positioned uni-
formly over [0 ,25 ]. The extent of the response ﬁelds
decreases with the eccentricity of the stimulus relative
to the fovea.

(given by the model after stabilization) for each of
the 200 stimuli positioned uniformly over [0 ,25 ]
and not only by applying the projection. The ﬁg-
ure 2 shows ﬁrst that the response ﬁeld is char-
acterized by a ﬁring rate that is maximal for a
speciﬁc stimulus eccentricity and that gradually
declines for eccentricities going oﬀ this preferred
eccentricity. Interestingly, the size of the response
ﬁeld is larger and the maximum ﬁring rate lower
for units located in the caudal SC than for those
located more rostrally.

3.2 Accuracy and eﬀect of local inactivation

The model encodes the location of a visual stimu-
lus with an averaging decoding scheme (equation
4). The ﬁgure 3-a shows the actual locations of
point stimuli (ﬁlled symbols) and the center of
mass of their image on the SC (open symbols).
In spite of the log-polar transformation and of
the expanded response ﬁelds, the model exhibits
fairly good accuracy (cf. Fig. 3-c,d). For a stim-
ulus presented in the parafoveal visual ﬁeld, the
point image is slightly biased toward the caudal
end of the SC, whereas the bias is toward the ros-
tral end when the same stimulus is presented in the
peripheral visual ﬁeld. Small position mismatches
are observed when the stimulus point image ap-
proaches the rostral and lateral edges of the SC,

Fig. 3 SC lesions. On left part of the ﬁgure, the small
open symbols illustrate the center of mass of the stabi-
lized SC activity in response to a stimulus presented
at diﬀerent locations in the visual ﬁeld (target coor-
dinates are indicated by the small ﬁlled symbols). In
the intact model (insets a, c & d), the relative er-
ror in target encoding is less than 2.5% along both the
rostro-caudal axis and the vertical axis with a stronger
error in the foveal region 1.8% that decreases to 0.26%
in caudal positions. However, the mean error is almost
constant along the vertical axis (mean=0.88, standard
deviation=0.07). After a localized inactivation centered
at position (5 , 0 ) (insets b, c & d), there is a dra-
matic increase in encoding error in the vicinity of the
lesioned site

i.e., collicular regions that encode targets located
in the foveal ﬁeld or along the vertical meridian.
These are probably artiﬁcial distortions due to the
fact that we do not take into account the interac-
tions between the two colliculi, as discussed in the
concluding part.

We tested the eﬀects of inactivating a small
part of the SC (cf section 2.3 for details on the pro-
cedure). In the ﬁgure 3-b, the inactivation is cen-
tered on a site encoding the location (5 , 0 ) (polar
coordinates). A SC activity evoked by a less eccen-
tric stimulus (4 , 0 ) is shifted toward the rostral
SC whereas an activity evoked by a more eccen-
tric stimulus (6 , 0 ) is shifted toward the caudal
end (cf. Fig. 3-c,d). Because of the inactivation,
the symmetry of the population that is normally
active is altered; it is re-established by a shift of SC
activity away from the lesion. In comparison with

Fig. 4 Double target paradigm. Colored circles cor-
respond to the position of SC activity center as a func-
tion of the relative distance between two stimuli pre-
sented at same eccentricity and opposite directions. a
When the distance is small, the competition between
the two stimuli results in an averaging activity in an in-
termediate position. b A selection occurs onto one of the
two stimuli beyond a relative distance of approximately
40 , 41  and 47  (vertical lines), corresponding respec-
tively to stimuli at ⇢ = 15  in red, ⇢ = 10  in blue and
⇢ = 5  in green

the time that was required to reach stability before
inactivation, the shifted locus of activity stabilizes
approximately 50 ms later, corresponding to an
added delay of 20%.

3.3 Stimuli interaction

The simultaneous presentation of two visual stim-
uli activates initially two populations in the
SC, which may correspond to an unstable state
(Rougier and Vitay, 2006). Starting from an in-
active population state, after some time, only one
single population remains because the symmetry
has been broken by the noise and this leads the
system into a stable equilibrium where only one
location is active.

The ﬁgure 4-a shows that when the angular
distance between two stimuli of identical size pre-
sented at same eccentricity and opposite directions
is small, the population stabilizes at a site which
is intermediate between the sites that encode the

6

location of each stimulus. For larger angular dis-
tances, the population stabilizes at either one of
the two sites (cf. Fig. 4-b). Starting from an inac-
tive state (null population activation), this selec-
tion is made possible because white noise is added
to the activity (see Methods) in order to break the
symmetry in the numerical implementation. Inter-
estingly enough, this selection is associated with
an increase in the time taken to stabilize the ac-
tivity at a single site on the collicular map. The
ﬁgure 4 shows that this limit is higher when stim-
uli are more peripheral. Indeed, for these stimuli
their activation extent is higher and the cartesian
distance between them is lower due to the loga-
rithmic projection. The limit value is around 50 
for low eccentricities (⇢ = 5 ) and around 40  for
higher eccentricities (⇢ = 10 , 15 ) (cf. Fig. 4).

As shown in ﬁgure 6, the simultaneous presen-
tation of two equivalent targets (same size, same
intensity) at diﬀerent eccentricities leads to a spa-
tial bias towards the more foveal stimulus location
due to the logarithmic magniﬁcation (cf. Fig.1 ). A
selection of the most foveal stimulus occurs beyond
a relative distance of approximately 31 , 37  and
43  (vertical lines), corresponding to the brighter
stimulus at ⇢ = 15  in red, ⇢ = 10  and ⇢ = 5 ,
respectively.

⇥

This bias could be compensated by increasing
the salience of the distal target (size, brightness..).
The ﬁgure 7 shows the results of presenting two
stimuli of same size but at diﬀerent eccentricities
⇢) and diﬀerent intensities ( 1.0 and
(⇢ and 0.75
⇢ such that the
1.5) for three diﬀerent values of
brightness of the more caudal target is 50% higher
than the other. We found that for some speciﬁc ec-
centricity values (⇢ = 10 ) there exists an angular
distance threshold (41 ) where we got a balanced
selection between the two targets (see blue circles
in ﬁgure 7). However, we found that for the eccen-
tricity values (⇢ = 5 ), there are three stages : an
averaging stage, a balanced stage and a biased ﬁ-
nal stage (see red circles in ﬁgure 7). The diﬀerence
of brightness is not high enough to compensate for
the bias of the caudal target. Finally, we found for
the eccentricity value ⇢ = 15 , an averaging stage
followed by a biased stage towards the more cau-
dal target. The diﬀerence of brightness was so high
that it inverted the bias.

tional models, can predict a large range of ob-
servations made in neurophysiological and behav-
ioral studies. Three core principles characterize
this model: the log-polar transformation of the en-
tire retinal input (as opposed to the center of stim-
uli only), the balance between the excitatory in-
put from the Retina and the lateral interactions
(short-term excitation and global constant inhibi-
tion) and the dynamics of the population activity.

4 Discussion

The proposed model, based upon a few simple
assumptions which are shared by most computa-

Our study bears resemblance to the study by
Nakahara et al. (2006) showing that an asymmet-
ric kernel led to a spread of activity across the SC
(see their ﬁgure 3). Indeed, they both share classi-
cal hypotheses, particularly representations in to-

pographical maps (hence similar ﬁgures), investi-
gating the model predictions on classical issues (le-
sioning studies and double target paradigms). Our
results are consistent with the absence of spread
when using symmetric kernels, however, we were
not interested in testing asymmetric kernels in
our model for several reasons. First, because it
was absent in other studies (Kang and Lee, 2000;
Moschovakis et al., 2001) or very moderate (An-
derson et al., 1998), it is possible that the spread
of activity results from an experimental artefact.
Second, to our knowledge, there is no anatomical
data supporting asymmetric connection ﬁelds in
the SC. Finally, Nakahara et al. (2006) recognized
that “if the spread is caused by asymmetric intrin-
sic connections, it may be just an epiphenomenon,
with no contribution to movement control”.

fect: intensity). Two stimuli having diﬀerent bright-
ness intensities (1.0 and 1.5, respectively) presented at

opposite directions (
eccentricities (0.75⇢ and ⇢, respectively). Colored cir-
cles correspond to the position of SC activity center as
a function of the relative angular distance between two
stimuli (= 2 ) for three diﬀerent values of ⇢ ( 15  in
red, 10  in blue and 5  in green). a When the distance
is small, the competition between the two stimuli results
in an averaging activity in an intermediate position. b
A selection occurs onto one of the two stimuli beyond
a relative distance of approximately 38 , 39  and 42 
(vertical lines), corresponding to the brighter stimulus
at ⇢ = 15  in red, ⇢ = 10  and ⇢ = 5 , respectively.
The results show that the bias towards the more foveal
stimuli locations could be compensated by increasing
the salience of the peripheral target (brightness) (i.e.,
the competition results on the selection of the stimulus
with higher eccentricity).

Moreover, a major diﬀerence between our
model and theirs is the projection of the stim-
uli. As mentioned in the introduction, Nakahara
et al. (2006) used the common assumption of log-
polar transformation to determine the position of
the stimulus center in the SC, using the projection
of the stimulus central coordinates in the retinal
map, then, gave empirically a shape to the stimu-
lus by setting on that position a circle. This means
that the transformation of the shape of the stimu-
lus by the log-polar function is not directly taken
into account, which is a simpliﬁcation shared with
several models. Diﬀerently from Nakahara et al.
(2006), we propose to project the entire retinal

stimulus onto the collicular map while keeping
the symmetric commonly-used lateral kernels. We
show in our experiments that after some cycles
of computation, the balance between excitation
and inhibition makes the initial distorted activ-
ity—corresponding to the projection of the stimu-
lus—become symmetric. Indeed, a major point of
our study is to show that this resulting dynamic
“transition" is enough to induce powerful emerging
properties.

Stabilization onto a unique and stereotyped pop-
ulation In his theoretical study of neural ﬁelds,
Amari (1977) showed that the neural ensemble
evoked by a constant input signal stabilizes onto
a unique population of active units with a stereo-
typed shape, regardless of the position, the size
and the strength of the input. Our simulations
replicate this phenomenon: the activity evoked by
a retinal stimulus stabilizes on a unique and stereo-
typed population in the SC, regardless of the stim-
ulus size, luminance and position in the visual ﬁeld.
After the initial excitation from the retina, the lo-
cal excitatory connectivity creates a positive feed-
back loop, where units activate one another. Two
processes contribute to hold this self-sustained ex-
citation on a circumscribed population and to pre-
vent it from growing and spreading further. First,
its magnitude is limited by the saturation intro-
duced by the non-linearity in the activation func-
tion (implemented in the rectiﬁcation function).
Second, its lateral spread is limited by the con-
stant level of surround inhibition. Regardless of
the size and distribution of the initial excitation,
the combined eﬀects of the positive feedback loop
and the two limiting processes modify the activa-
tion proﬁle until the excitation and inhibition bal-
ance each other to maintain a stereotyped proﬁle
of activation (equilibrium state). The SC has been
reported to be the target of endogenous (Lee and
Hall, 2006; Meredith and Ramoa, 1998; Munoz and
Istvan, 1998; Olivier et al., 1999) as well as exoge-
nous inhibitory inﬂuences, e.g., from the substan-
tia nigra pars reticulata (Chevalier et al., 1985;
Hikosaka et al., 1983), the central mesencephalic
reticular formation (Wang et al., 2010) and the
contralateral SC (Olivier et al., 1998). It is worth-
while to mention that, in our model, the ques-
tion of the origin and distribution of the inhibi-
tion is not critical, as the same outcome is ob-
served, regardless of whether it is homogeneously
distributed (isotropic) or follows a Gaussian dis-
tribution within the SC. The most critical point
is that its spatial extent is suﬃcient large to hold

the spread of excitation. Indeed, we assumed a con-
stant inhibition at the whole population level since
there is no clear data concerning extended lateral
inhibition in the deep superior colliculus. This in-
hibition could result from eﬀerent inﬂuences from
other structures such as the basal ganglia. How-
ever, this question should be critical for Nakahara
et al. (2006) model, where local or global inhibi-
tion requires a particular inhibitory connections
proﬁle within the SC with no clear consensus for
its existence. Finally, the observation that the ac-
tive population has the same size regardless of the
location of the stimulus in the visual ﬁeld conﬁrms
the inferences that were made several decades ago
by James McIlwain (McIlwain, 1976). Indeed, this
neurobiologist demonstrated that the population
of SC neurons activated by a point visual stimulus
ought to be constant, regardless of its eccentric-
ity. This translation invariance was later corrobo-
rated by recordings of saccade-related neurons in
the monkey SC showing that the size of the ac-
tive area is relatively invariant with saccade size
and direction (Anderson et al., 1998; Munoz and
Wurtz, 1995).

Changes in accuracy and latency after local inacti-
vation The dynamics described in this study cor-
responds to the evolution of the activation onto the
SC map, from the initial excitation to its stabiliza-
tion. The duration of the activation increases with
the distance between both activation states. This
distance depends primarily upon two parameters:
the number and the size (spatial extent and magni-
tude) of the discrete stimuli that feed the SC map.
It is also impacted by changes in the activation
proﬁle induced by local inactivations. Our results
are consistent with the changes in saccade accu-
racy observed when a small amount of anesthetics
(lidocaine) is injected locally in the SC. Indeed,
as shown in Lee et al. (1988) study, ﬁgure 2, hy-
pometria and hypermetria were observed after in-
jecting lidocaine on one side (or the other) of the
location corresponding to the target position. We
show similar eﬀects in ﬁgure Fig. 3-b; hypometria
and hypermetria on the either side of the lesion
site. Since our model was not designed to gener-
ate saccades, our simulations indicate that this in-
accuracy is due to an altered encoding of target
location rather than an impaired execution of sac-
cades. It is explained by the dynamics of neural ac-
tivation that elapses from the initial excitation to
its stabilization. The equilibrium state is achieved
by a gradual shift of the active population away
from the inactivated site. Because the inactivation

9

alters the symmetry of activation that normally
expands from the center of the initial excitation,
the symmetry is re-established away from the le-
sion, in a more lateral position leading to a change
in the topographical encoding of the target loca-
tion. Because it is aimed at re-establishing equi-
librium between the expanding excitation and the
surround inhibition, the shift has amplitude and
duration that depend upon the overlap between
the initial excitation and the lesion. Even though
the size of the active population does not depend
upon the stimulus size in normal conditions, after
SC inactivation, a stimulus located at the same
position in the visual ﬁeld will be encoded at dif-
ferent sites in the SC, depending upon the size
of the stimulus. This model prediction, which is
consistent with recent observations (Goﬀart et al.,
2012; Hafed et al., 2008), simply results from the
fact that diﬀerent stimulus sizes lead to diﬀerent
initial excitations in the SC. A larger stimulus ini-
tially excites a larger population and the overlap
between this initial excitation and the inactivated
site determines the trajectory of the SC activity,
away from the inactivated neurons, in search for its
stabilization. This delayed stabilization could also
account for the increase of saccade latencies after
SC inactivation (Goﬀart et al., 2012; Hikosaka and
Wurtz, 1985; Sparks et al., 1990).

The response ﬁelds of SC neurons The logarithmic
projection explains why the response ﬁelds of more
caudal neurons in the SC have larger width and
become more asymmetrical. These properties ﬁt
well with the movement ﬁeld properties described
by electrophysiological studies (Munoz and Wurtz,
1995; Sparks et al., 1976). Indeed, the saccade-
related neurons in the SC burst maximally prior to
saccades having a particular direction and ampli-
tude, regardless of the starting position of the eye
in the orbit and their resulting tunings are very
similar to those resulting from our model (e.g.,
compare our Fig. 2 with the ﬁgure 8 in (Munoz
and Wurtz, 1995)). The discharge then declines for
other vectors (Schiller and Stryker, 1972; Sparks
and Mays, 1980; Sparks et al., 1976; Wurtz and
Goldberg, 1972). Interestingly, our model shows
how the maximum ﬁring rate declines with the
rostro-caudal position of the neuron on the SC map
(cf. Fig. 2).

Target selection during image exploration Several
studies described the path of saccades generated
by subjects exploring various visual images (Lévy-
Schoen, 1974; Noton and Stark, 1971; Yarbus,

1967). They showed that the attractive value of an
object strongly depends upon its distance relative
to the previously ﬁxated object. This attraction is
greater for objects close to the fovea (small sac-
cades are more frequent). Such scanpaths do not
necessarily rely upon cognitive strategies since our
model produces the same performance when its vi-
sual input contains multiple identical objects. Be-
cause of the log-polar transformation, two visual
stimuli of similar size initially activate two popu-
lations with sizes that depend on their eccentricity:
larger populations are activated when the stim-
ulus is projected near the central region than in
more peripheral regions (cf. Fig. 5). The more ros-
tral population wins the competition because of its
larger initial size (cf. Fig. 6). The same mechanism
can account for the so-called remote distractor ef-
fect ﬁrst reported by (Lévy-Schoen, 1969). When
two identical stimuli are simultaneously presented
at two diﬀerent locations, human subjects (Walker
et al., 1997) or monkeys (Dorris et al., 2007) favor
the stimulus which is closer to the fovea and take a
longer time to select this target. Our study shows
that the selection simply results from the combined
eﬀect of pattern of activity (central excitation sur-
rounded by inhibition) and from the geometrical
representation of the visual ﬁeld within a SC map
(magniﬁcation of the foveal ﬁeld).

Temporal dynamics during the competition Using
a variety of testing conditions (diﬀerent target lo-
cations, diﬀerent inter-stimulus intervals), several
studies reported increases in saccade latency that
were interpreted as resulting from a selection pro-
cess (Findlay, 1983; Godijn and Theeuwes, 2002;
Honda, 2005; Weber and Fischer, 1994). We have
discussed above the case where the stimuli were
presented at diﬀerent eccentricities. A more subtle
case happens when the two stimuli have the same
eccentricity but diﬀerent elevations. Initially, they
activate the same number of units (cf. Fig. 5A,C).
However, during a ﬁrst phase that follows the stim-
uli presentation, the two corresponding locations
in the SC are eligible for selection. Then, the two
populations ultimately stabilize onto one single
population whose location depends upon the an-
gular distance between the stimuli. If the stimuli
are spatially close (cf. Fig. 5A), i.e., if the ini-
tial excitations overlap, the two populations merge
and stabilize at a site that encodes a location cor-
responding to the center of mass of the stimuli.
Note that this averaging process could also apply
to multiple stimuli. Such a merging phenomenon
could account for the so-called global eﬀect ob-

10

served in saccades made in response to multiple
stimuli and distractors (Coren and Hoenig, 1972;
Deubel et al., 1984; Findlay, 1982; Ottes et al.,
1984; Van der Stigchel et al., 2011). If the two stim-
uli activate populations in the SC that are sepa-
rated by a fringe of mutual inhibition (cf. Fig. 5B),
the bipolar state could theoretically last forever
if the activities were perfectly noiseless and the
population is initially inactive. However, the noise
added at the level of the visual input introduces
ﬂuctuations that break the symmetry and lead to
the selection of a single population.

Conclusion The work presented here demon-
strates that many properties of the SC activity
and the oculomotor behavior can result from the
geometry of the retinotopy and the pattern of SC
activation (excitation surrounded by inhibition).
Our model represents a solid base for investigating
further the inﬂuence of each aﬀerent input to this
brainstem region. It also relies on a small number
of free parameters (see Table 1.) which, exception
made of the time step of numerical simulations,
have a clear biological meaning. This opens many
perspectives easy to implement. Firstly, the free
parameters can be adapted to ﬁt with neurobiolog-
ical observations such as the size of receptive ﬁelds,
the dynamics of SC activation, etc. Secondly, they
can also be adapted to ﬁt with behavioral observa-
tions or, for a given set of parameters (e.g., map-
ping functions, levels of inhibition, expanded le-
sion, visual stimuli of diﬀerent sizes etc.), to make
predictions on the behavioral performance in dif-
ferent species or in patients with diﬀerent kind of
scotoma. These free parameters can be estimated
from an optimization process, or be varied sys-
tematically, through massive numerical tests. In
conclusion, our work shows that behavioral per-
formances that seem complex can result from very
simple anatomo-functional principles. It also illus-
trates the catalytic inﬂuence of noise and ﬂuctua-
tions in the irreversible determination of the equi-
librium that will encode the location of a target to
foveate (Goﬀart et al., 2012; Hafed et al., 2008; Lee
et al., 1988) or to attend to (Zénon and Krauzlis,
2012).
