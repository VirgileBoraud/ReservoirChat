Abstract. The electrical domain, either domestic or industrial, beneﬁts
from a huge set of well-deﬁned norms at both the national and interna-
tional levels. However and surprisingly enough, there is no such norm
regarding the actual conception and structuration of electrical
diagrams, even though the basic symbols and notations remain the same.
Each company is actually free to design such diagram relative to its own
ex- perience, expertise and know-how. The diﬃculty is that such
diagrams, which are most of the time materialized as a PDF booklet, do
not re- ﬂect this implicit knowledge. In this paper, we introduce our
work on the extraction and the structuration of such knowledge using
ad-hoc graph and text analysis as well as clustering techniques.
Starting from a set of raw documents, we propose an end-to-end solution
that oﬀers a company dependent structured view, of any electrical
diagram.

Introduction

The electrical domain, either domestic or industrial, beneﬁts from a
huge set of well deﬁned norms at both the national and international
levels. These norms have to be enforced when designing a new electrical
diagram and during the actual physical construction of the circuit. In
that regards, electrical workers have generally to deal with a booklet
describing the overall circuit splited into several subparts, each one
ﬁtting on a regular A4 sheet paper. This arbitrary and constrained
segmentation of the whole diagram implies a graph structure that does
not follow the logical structure of the underlying object. It is indeed
quite similar to the decomposition of an image into pixels sharing no
similarities with the inner structure of the image. The problem we are
interested in this paper is to ﬁnd original methods for discovering the
implicit structure of electrical dia- grams using the PDF description.
In this context, we are working with a software company, Algo’Tech
Informatique, that provides a set of specialized tools for the design of
electrical diagrams. These tools are able to provide a synthetic view of
any electrical diagram and to produce the corresponding booklet. To do
so,

2

Knowledge extraction and structuration

whenever Algo’Tech Informatique has a new customer, it gets its existing
elec- trical diagrams to analyse them and then adapt the database and
the softwares according them. Hence, Algo’Tech informatique experts face
two challenges : the ﬁrst one is to understand the reasoning and
planning process of electrical diagrams by their customers in order to
formalize it. The second challenge is to make the customer’s experts
explain their work by supporting them during the exploration of their
own habits and knowledge. Besides, since each customer designs freely
diagrams according its own experience, expertise and know-how, diagrams
do not reﬂect the implicit knowledge. And yet this knowledge is im-
portant, since it holds the footprint of the customers. These ones are
indeed attached to their way of drawing and disposing electrical
components inside a circuit (they are able to recognize the work of
their company whenever they see it) and they are attached to continue to
have it once they used Algo’Tech Infor- matique softwares. So, to
extract the ”footprints”, Algo’Tech Informatique has to review the
internal arrangement of electrical components into each page of each
electrical diagram and to compare the arrangements between them to ﬁnd
similarities. This work results from an extensive and non-automated
collabora- tion between the software company and the customer. It is
also time-consuming, informal (and not stricly replicable) and complex
(documents mix texts and di- agrams) in the sense that it results from
non constrained interviews between humans. Consequently, we aim for an
automatic knowledge extraction process speciﬁc to a customer and based
on its past projects ( generally materialized as a restricted set of
scanned PDF booklets).

2 Review of existing work

2.1 Technical documents analysis

The capitalization of the knowledge of technical documents is a real
problem in the industry. From one hand, the ﬁeld of analysis of
technical documents, which has been investigated for several years in
many kinds of domains is mostly fo- cused on image analysis and
recognition [1]. On the other hand, there is a great deal of work in the
ﬁeld of document analysis, including PDFs, in order to retrieve the text
content, but again, that leaves aside the graphical content [2]. However
in the domain of technical diagrams, both of these elements, text
content and image content, are important for the understanding and the
interpretation of documents. Another neglected ﬁeld is the diagram
interpretation one. The iden- tiﬁcation of the structure in a diagram,
the semantics of its constituents and their relationship, is almost
always domain-speciﬁc which make global approach diﬃcult. But, recently,
[3] focuses on the problem of diagram interpretation and reasoning by
exploiting a deep learning algorithm that learns on a basis of 5,000
diagrams, one order of magnitude bigger than our 160 PDF booklets that
we are currently analysing (plus the 500 ones that we would like to
test). These reasons makes us to look for an innovative solution to
analyse small volume of electrical diagrams, without using standard
methods.

2.2 Expertise extraction

Another problem that industry faces is the expertise capitalization.
Deﬁned as an intellectual capital resulting from the knowledge and the
experience from the collaborators and/or the experts, the expertise is
represented implicitly through several documents. Using many diﬀerent
methods, companies try to collect and disseminate such expertise to all
the employees, so that they can take advantage from it. But even then,
the challenge is still complex because of the experts mental
representation of their work. Indeed [4] conﬁrmed the existence of dif-
ference between senior experts and beginner experts mental
representation. The ﬁrst ones have a conceptualization rather of
gist-type, more fuzzy, conceptual, intuitive, using prototypes and high
level concepts. In the opposite, beginner experts have a rather
verbatim-type conceptualization, which means detailed, analytical,
controlled, using low-level concepts.

There is thus diﬀerent ways to describe diagrams : through the explicit
struc- tured data and through the implicit structure or mental
representation of the experts. In the following section, we describe the
knowledge extraction of raw data using the titles and text into
electrical diagrams (Figure 1, label A, B, C). From this point, we will
refer to Algo’Tech Informatique experts as experts, and we will precise
in other cases.

3 Raw data : Electrical diagrams in PDFs and DXFs ﬁles

Companies that draw electrical diagrams have to deal mostly with two
type of ﬁles : the PDF ones, the most commonly used type, and the
Autodesk’s Drawing Exchange Format (DXF). PDFs mix texts and diagrams
and possess their own local structure : Usually the PDF document has a
title, a list of pages, and thus, the circuit that goes through many
pages, as in Figure 1. In each folio, there are four important elements:
its title, its number (diﬀerent from the page number), the electrical
components (and voltage indications) and its indication to other folios.
These last ones are the link that make the rebuild of the whole diagram
possible. A DXF ﬁle, in the other hand, is a Computer-aided design (CAD)
data ﬁle that enables data interoperability between many CAD softwares.
It is considered an open access format because it is basicaly an ASCII
ﬁle that can be read by text editors. Considered as an ASCII translation
of a drawing ﬁle, a DXF ﬁle, allow, by analysing the blocks and their
attributes, to extract data and meta-data related to electrical
components symbols, in particular coordinates, attributes and block
name. It permits thus to avoid computer vision or image recognition on
the PDF ﬁles. Hence, since PDF booklets give a graphical view of
electrical diagrams using symbols and texts, and DXF ﬁles contain more
techni- cal data about the layout of the diagram into pages, the
alliance of their analysis enables a quasi-complete analysis of
electrical diagram and a more exhaustive interpretation.

Knowledge extraction and structuration

1st approach : From raw data to concepts

We present in this subsection a ﬁrst approach that allow us to conﬁrm
hypoth- esise regarding our data before to go further : for a given
customer, just by studying his electrical diagrams (PDF mainly), it is
possible to put in light a structure and dominant concepts that has a
business meaning for him. We wanted to get a global view of each
electrical diagram to get a global idea about the struture. For that, we
transformed each diagram into graphs by mimicking the expert’s
reasoning. We used the following process : for each folio of each
diagram, we use the folio’s number (Figure 1, label B) as the id of a
node and the related folio’s title (Figure 1, label A) as the label of
that node. Then, we use the folio’s indication (Figure 1, label C) to
establish links between nodes. We thus manage to transform a linear
booklet of many pages, into one single representation holding in one
sheet. This ﬁrst step make us realize redundancy in folios names, so we
extracted all the titles all booklets combined, to analyze them and
compute an intersection between them. We obtain thus a set of com- mon
words to all booklets that we will refer to as the concepts of the
customer from this point. These words were used as a replacement for the
nodes labels, which results in an homogenized set of graphs. Finally,
all the simpliﬁed graphs were merged into one global graph of concepts
by aggregating links and nodes gradually. We thus, obtain a single view
of the customer business logic grouping all the concepts that the
customer have already used in his previous electrical diagrams, and all
the possible relations between these concepts. The ﬁnal graph is, hence,
a representation of the knowledge of the customer. Through this pre-
liminary work, we manage to do 2 things : First, we managed to group
folios according their content. Indeed, by doing the reverse path (from
the abstract view to the raw data), it is possible to group and analyse
folios according to the concept they belong to. This capacity to group
folios according to the concept will be used for the next section.
Second, we structured raw data into a view of the customer’s knowledge
that put in light concepts and relations between them. By doing this, we
conﬁrm the existence of redundancy in the work or electrical diagrams
designers for a given designer, at least at the global level. In the
next section, we chose to focus on the layout of electrical components
(Figure 1, label D) into folios, in order to conﬁrm the existence of
redundancy, and by extend a footprint in the drawing.

2nd approach : Footprint extraction using datamining

This second approach is based on a second hypothesis : each electrical
diagram is an instanciation of the customer knowledge and by studying
it, it is possible to extract it. We thus based our work on the work of
[5] and more recently [6], that both deﬁned the KDD process as 3 steps :
a pre-processing step, a data mining step and a post-processing step.
Preprocessing Two treatments are done : the creation of data sets and
their transformation. Considered data are sequences : a set of
electrical components

extracted from each folio and ordered according their growing x, y
coordinates. We created two data sets : the ﬁrst one group sequences
according the concept they belong to, whereas the second gather together
all sequences independently of the concepts they belong to. Finally,
each sequence is translated into a binary vector of 25 units (since 25
families of electrical components exists according experts), each
indicating the presence or absence of a family into a folio. Data mining
Once the data prepared, we applied a Hierarchical clustering (HC) method
on the two sets in order, from one hand, to study and compare the
clusters that appear, and from the other hand, to put in light the
footprint into the sequences. We get inspired by the work of [7], who
use the HC analysis to rebuild the grammar (set of rules and patterns)
from sequences. For further technical details on this method, please
refer to [8]. On each set of data, the algorithm uses the Jaccard
distance and average linkage method as parameters, since it was the
combination that shows the better Cophenetic correlation co- eﬃcient.
For every sets and subsets, it results in a dendogram (the standard
representation in HC) and a cluster-tree (a graph). Post-Processing For
every sets of vectors, each cluster obtained is described as a binary
vector corresponding to the union of the binary vectors of the previous
clusters. This work of identiﬁcation of clusters makes possible the
comparison between the clusters obtained with both data sets : Exception
apart (folios which weren’t plot at the expected location), all the
cluster-trees of the ﬁrst data set were found in the cluster-tree of the
second data set. Thus, besides this approach allows to put in light
particular cases or mistakes in an electrical diagram, it also shows
that there is indeed recurrence and regularities into a cutomer’s
working way : it then conﬁrms the existence of a footprint.

6 Discussion

In this paper, we exposed two approaches we developed for knowledge
extraction and representation in the ﬁeld of electrical diagrams : the
ﬁrst one creates a global view of the customer business logic using
graphs, on the basis of extracted text. The second approach spells
implicit knowledge out from the internal arrangments of all the folios
electrical components, using clustering analysis. It detects and
extracts patterns, that represent customers footprints, from data sets.
These two approaches complement each other in order to give a view of
the electrical diagrams that assist, improve and accelerate experts
analysis. In a more global dimension, this work shows that each
electrical diagram is an instantiation of the customer knowledge from
which it is possible to reconstruct the expertise knowledge as well as
habits of work. The study of such habits is still an ongoing work. In
order to have the full picture, and to provide more assistance to the
experts, we are currently studying the electrical components sequences
according the wiring cables with the hypothesis that such sequences held
more information about the working rules and habits for a given
customer. To explore this, we propose a neural network approach in order
to discover the ”grammar” rules governing the sequence arrangement : the
Elman model [7]. Our preliminary

6

Knowledge extraction and structuration

results indicate that it is possible to learn and to predict as long as
the sequence length is not too large. Tests and analysis are still on
going and alternatives, like other recurrent neural networks, are also
considered. On the medium term, by improving the expertise analysis and
by extending the tools that assist the designer in her or his work, we
aim at showing that there is an implicit dimension in the planning of
every electrical diagrams as it was shown in [9].
