Methods. We model DG as a sparse layer and CA3 as a reservoir of randomly connected 
neurons. A readout (hilus) is trained to predict the next DG pattern to be fed back to the 
reservoir, following the model of Lisman et al. (2005), which allows the hippocampus to 
learn sequences. Another readout is trained to decode the current pattern and send the 
content of hippocampal replay to the PFC. The PFC is trained as an actor critic and is able 
to send a query for hippocampal replay.

However, the network fails to recall the 2D, 3D and semantic sequences because it does not ‚Äúknow‚Äù which sequence to recall.

An autoencoder with contextual weight modulation is used to simulate interactions between the hippocampus and the

Results. Modulation of hippocampal recall through projections from the contextual layer 
(PFC) enables the model to perform the contextual memory task. The relative efficacy of 
layer vs. weight modulation is layer-dependent. Furthermore, the PFC‚ÜíDG connection‚Äôs 
ability to modulate recall is weaker than those of downstream modulations

The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex interact bidirectionally through multiple 
pathways. Their interaction is thought to play an important role in contextual controlled 
learning. The hippocampus enables rapid learning of multimodal associations. The 
prefrontal cortex learns to identify contextually relevant information to control 
in a goal-directed manner 
decision-making and hippocampal memory recall 
(Chateau-Laurent & Alexandre, 2021).

Methods. We model the hippocampus with an autoencoder-like network, following an 
approach similar to Santos-Pata et al. (2021). The input pattern is the concatenation of 
two odor patterns and an empty pattern. The target output is the concatenation of the 
input patterns and the pattern associated to the rewarded odor. The relative number of 
neurons in the entorhinal cortex, dentate gyrus, CA3 and CA1 layers follows the 
proportion found in biological rats. The contextual layer projects to bias different 
synaptic weights and layers.

Preliminary results. Initial simulations suggest that the model is better able to adapt to 
reward reversal when the hippocampus module is used. Future studies will assess the 
ability of the model to perform better using hyperparameter optimization.

The hippocampus is thought to be involved in episodic memory, spatial navigation and relational memory. These 

apparently disparate functions can be accounted by considering that the more general and abstract hippocampal function 

is to allow Ô¨Çexible navigation through the space of cortical representations. Yet, a unifying computational framework is
