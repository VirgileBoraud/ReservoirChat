Decision making

(1) the reasonable sort, whereby we accede to 
rational arguments (2) the sort that is triggered by 
external circumstances, such as overhearing a 
rumor; (3) the sort that is prompted by our 
submission to something within ourselves, such 
as a habit formed by past actions; (4) the sort that 
results from a sudden change of mood such as 
might be caused by a feeling of grief; and (5) the 
rare sort that is a consequence of our own voluntary 
choice, which will be identiﬁed as the “will to 
believe.”

The transition from reﬂex action to volitional is not 
abrupt and sharp. Familiar instances of individual 
acquisition of motor coordination are furnished by 
the cases in which short, simple movements, 
whether reﬂex or not, are by practice under volition 
combined into new sequences and become in 
time habitual in the sense that though able to be 
directed they no longer require concentration of 
attention upon them for their execution.

Rougier & Hutt, 2012 

A dual particle system (degenerated neural ﬁeld) 
whose initial state governs ﬁnal state. 

dx/dt = α(1 − x) + (x − y)(1 − x), x > 0 
dy/dt = α(1 − y) + (y − x)(1 − y), y > 0 

Noise (i.e. initial position) induces symmetry 
breaking and ﬁnal decision.

A tentative deﬁnition 
Yin and Knowlton (2006), Graybiel (2008), Seger and Spiering (2011) 

• Elicited by a particular context or stimulus 

→ stimulus-response as opposed to action-outcome 

• Acquired via experience 

→ require extensive training or repetition 

• Performed automatically 

→ the mere presence of the stimulus induces the response 

• Resistant to outcome devaluation 

→ disengagement from the goal 

• Performed unconsciously 
→ without “thinking” about it 

XKCD #242

A simple question

Action-outcome then stimulus-response?


Action-outcome comes ﬁrst until being transformed into stimulus-response 

Action-outcome versus stimulus-response?


Both processes are present and compete for expression 

Action-outcome with stimulus-response?


Final decision is a mix of both processes 

Action-outcome and stimulus-response?


Processes cooperate and inﬂuence each other, always

Dopamine as RPE

Sutton & Barto, 1998

Schulz et al., 1997

Daw et al. (2005)

Stimulus

“A broad range of neural and behavioral data 
suggests that the brain contains multiple systems 
for behavioral choice, including one associated with 
prefrontal cortex and another with dorsolateral 
striatum. However, such a surfeit of control raises 
an additional choice problem: how to arbitrate 
between the systems when they disagree. Here, we 
consider dual-action choice systems from a 
normative perspective, using the computational 
theory of reinforcement learning. We identify a key 
trade-oﬀ pitting computational simplicity against the 
ﬂexible and statistically eﬃcient use of experience. 
The trade-oﬀ is realized in a competition between 
the dorsolateral striatal and prefrontal systems…”

Dezfouli et al. (2013)

“… Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) has 
been argued to underlie the goal-directed process; 
however, the way in which it interacts with habits 
and the structure of the habitual process has 
remained unclear. According to a ﬂat architecture, 
the habitual process corresponds to model-free RL, 
and its interaction with the goal-directed process is 
coordinated by an external arbitration mechanism. 
Alternatively, the interaction between these 
systems has recently been argued to be 
hierarchical, such that the formation of action 
sequences underlies habit learning and a goal-
directed process selects between goal-directed 
actions and habitual sequences of actions to reach 
the goal…”

Ashby et al. (2007)

Stimulus

“… The model assumes 2 neural pathways from 
sensory association cortex to the premotor area 
that mediates response selection. A longer and 
slower path projects to the premotor area via the 
striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus. A faster, 
purely cortical path projects directly to the 
premotor area. The model assumes that the 
subcortical path has greater neural plasticity 
because of a dopamine-mediated learning signal 
from the substantia nigra. In contrast, the cortical-
cortical path learns more slowly via (dopamine 
independent) Hebbian learning…”

Piron et al. (2016)

Stimulus

“… Said diﬀerently, we managed to explicitly 
dissociate reinforcement learning from Hebbian 
learning and demonstrated covert learning inside 
the basal ganglia. These results suggest that a 
behavioral decision results from both the 
cooperation (acquisition) and competition 
(expression) of two distinct but entangled memory 
systems, the goal-directed system and the habit 
system that may represent the two ends of the 
same graded phenomenon.

Conclusion

Habit acquisition and habit expression 

→ These are two different processes even though they’re entangled 
→ Basal ganglia serves as an implicit supervisor 
→ Habit can be expressed outside BG (at least in the primate) 

The critic role of the BG 

→ Basal ganglia serves as a generic critic, for any “actor” 
→ No experimental evidence yet for the role of the cortex 
→ Ongoing experiments to measure RL vs HL inﬂuence on behavior 

Habits are a graded phenomenon
