AIM: build a vocal learning model underlying song learning in birds, and 
understand how to make it biologically plausible. 

INTRODUCTION

Sensorimotor learning: control problem which maps a sensory input into a motor 
output.

Imitation: the ability to replicate another’s behaviour, i.e. to generate an appropriate 
motor command to reproduce a sensory stimulus.

Inverse model learning: use the desired and actual motor configuration to estimate 
the motor commands needed to reach the desired configuration (to produce the 
appropriate sensory stimulus).

Crystallization

Reinforcement learning: learn an action policy to maximize the expected reward 
(which encode the goal of the learning).

strategy

Motor control model
● Respiratory system and vocal organs.

● Anatomical properties and small size of birds make the 

investigation of vocal fold mechanisms difficult.

● The vocal output is driven by a complex 

gesture-dependent control scheme, and the brain does not 
control each motor control parameter independently [2].

Perceptual space
● How the brain encodes sensory stimulus.

● Highly nonlinear dynamics.

● Low dimensional representation of the sensory space.

MOTOR CONTROL MODEL

PERCEPTUAL SPACE

AIM: learn the semantic modes in high-dimensional audio signals, and build a latent space useful for exploration.
In addition, have sound production in the model.

AIM: have a lower dimensional representation of the physical acoustic space,
which is the sensory space (sound). 

WaveGAN [3]
● Two player minimax game: generator VS discriminator [4].
● Inspired by DCGAN architecture [5].

Deep scattering transform [6]
● From MFCC coefficients introducing wavelets.
● Scattering coefficients can be seen as a convolutional neural networks. 

GENERATOR

DATASET
● Recordings from an adult zebra finch with sampling rate 16000.

PERSPECTIVES
Motor control model
● Explore the possibility to use a dynamical system model.
● More exaustive evaluation of the generative modle.

Exploration strategy
● Intrinsic motivation to drive motor exploration.
● Investigate the geometrical properties of latent space generated with the GAN.
