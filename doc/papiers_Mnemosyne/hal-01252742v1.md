Cortex

Basal Ganglia

 Novel behaviors require attention and ﬂexible thinking and therefore are dependent on cortex, whereas automatic behaviors has been assumed to be primarily mediated 
by subcortical structures. 

Much evidence suggests however, that subcortical structures, such as the striatum, make signiﬁcant contributions to initial learning. More recently, evidence has been 
accumulating that neurons in the associative striatum are selectively activated during early learning, whereas those in the sensorimotor striatum are more active after 
automaticity has developed. At the same time, other recent reports suggest that automatic behaviors are striatum- and dopamine-independent, and may be mediated 
entirely within cortex. Resolving this apparent conﬂict should be a major goal of future research.


 These ideas led to the theory that dominated the 20th century: Novel behaviors require attention and ﬂexible thinking and therefore are dependent on cortex, whereas 
automatic behaviors require neither of these and so are not mediated primarily by cortex. Instead, it has long been assumed that automatic behaviors are primarily 
mediated by subcortical structures.

Experimental conclusion

If habits were stored in basal ganglia, monkeys would not achieve peak 
performances in muscimol conditions for familiar stimuli. 

If habits were learned in cortex, monkeys would be able to reach peak 
performances in muscimol conditions for unfamiliar stimuli.

Acting is learning

Learning occurs at three different 
places simultaneously. 

① & ② Hebbian learning 

③ Reinforcement learning 

Cortex learns to reproduce previous 
repertories, regardless of whether or 
not are appropriate (HL). 

Fast basal ganglia trial-and-error 
learning (RL) biases slow cortical one 
(HL) ensuring that the correct 
behavior is produced.

Sensitivity to reward devaluation

Conclusion

The acquisition and the expression of habits are two entangled processes 
that can be dissociated experimentally. 

This experimental dissociation sheds light on the nature of the interaction 
between the basal ganglia and the cortex and their respective role in the 
initial formation and the later expression of habits. 

The model suggests that the basal ganglia implicitly supervises the cortex 
where habits are actually stored, but the cortex cannot learn them on its 
own. 

In the future, the model will be tested in different protocols in order to 
ensure the accuracy of its predictions.
