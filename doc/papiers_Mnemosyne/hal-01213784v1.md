Trying to understand perception by studying only neurons is like trying to understand
bird flight by studying only feathers: It just cannot be done. In order to understand bird
flight, we have to understand aerodynamics; only then do the structure of feathers and
the different shapes of birds’ wings make sense.

Spatio-temporal framework

Continuous space

G.Schöner, Dynamical Systems Approaches to Cognition, The Cambridge Handbook of Computational
Psychology, 2008.

... stable patterns of neuronal activation ultimately steer the periphery into
dynamical states, from which behavior emerges, without any need to ever
abstract from the space-time contiguous processes that embody cognition.

Continuous time
JP Spencer, S Perone and JS Johnson, The Dynamic Field Theory and Embodied Cognitive Dynamics,
Toward a Unified Theory of Development: Connectionism and Dynamic Systems Theory Re-Considered, 2009.

The first challenge is that sensori-motor systems evolve continuously in real
time, but cognition can jump from one state to another, that is, from one
thought to another

Computational Framework
Rougier & Fix (2011)

A unit is a set of arbitrary values that can vary along time under the influence of other
units and learning.

• Distributed

→ No supervisor nor executive

• Asynchronous

→ No clock, no scheduler

• Numerical

→ No symbols

• Adaptive

→ No a priori knowledge

We want to make sure that emerging properties are those of the model and not those
of the software running the model.

Function
The activity of a neural field can be interpreted from a functional point of view.

Measure
Using a specific set of parameters, the activity of a neural field can also be interpreted
as a measure (of the input).

The attentive brain

On ne voit que ce que l’on regarde
(We only see what we look at)
“L’Œil et l’Esprit”, Maurice Merleau Ponty, 1961

Everyone knows what attention is. It is the possession by the mind, in clear and vivid
form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of
thought. Focalization, concentration, of consciousness are of its essence. It implies
withdrawal from some things in order to deal effectively with others, and is a
condition which has a real opposite in the confused, dazed, scatterbrained state
which in French is called distraction, and Zerstreutheit in German.

W. James, 1890

Visual Attention

Spotlight metaphor
Attention is the capacity to select a relevant region of the sensory space

• Topological region of the sensory space → spatial attention
• Featural region of the sensory space → feature oriented attention
• Object as such → object oriented attention

A computational approach

Theories of Visual Attention

→ Saliency Maps (Itti & Koch, 2001)

Saliency map is a topographically arranged map that represents visual saliency of
a corresponding visual scene.

• Inhibition Of Return (IOR, Posner, 1980)

IOR operates to decrease the likelihood that a previsously inspected item in the
visual scene will be reinspected.

• Premotor Theory of Attention (Rizzolati, 1987)

Attention may derive from weaker activation of same fronto-parietal circuits.

Making saccades

Occular saccades lead to drastic changes in visual perception.

(Fix et al., 2007)

Spatial reference

• Independent of eye movements
• Eye-centered

Action in perception

• To anticipate the consequences

of own actions

• To update working memory

accordingly

Search task
The camera is placed in front of a
visual scene and is able to pan and
tilt. The task can be either to look for a
specific orientation or colour or to
look for a conjunction of such
features.

• Feature based attention facilitates processing of relevant features

• Model exhibits both overt and covert attention using same substrate

TimeTowards the organization of visual behavior

From sequential to parallel to sequential

• A bottom-up sequential exploratory behavior has emerged from distributed &

numeric computation.

• The sequential nature of the behavior is provided through the interaction with

the external world.

• We ensured no shortcut is made between the simulation and the behavior.

• How representations can be both stable and plastic ?

• Do current computational models give a fair account on cortical plasticity ?
• Are there other mechanisms or structures involved ?

Dynamic Self-Organizing maps
Rougier & Boniface (2010)

To what extent it is possible to have both stable and dynamic representations ?

Dynamic
The model must dynamically adapts itself to the data.

Stability
Model representations must be stable if the input is stable.

Topology
Two physically neighborhood cells mut have similar representations.

Conclusion

From neurons to behavior

• Still many questions to be addressed
• Embodiment is a key concepts
• Mathematics are helpful but unsufficient

Mathematical solutions do not characterize functional blocks

FilterDecisionTrackingMemoryIs there something like an objective behavior ?

We can connect the model to a pan-tilt camera
such that it looks away from a given stimulus

The actual behavior of the model depends on the links to its body. Ultimately, the
modeler is the one who decide on the behavior.
