Introduction 

As artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) technologies become more common in 
many areas of civic life, helping people of all ages become more comfort-
able with AI is becoming an important part of being a critical and 
active citizen (Alexandre et al., 2021). The necessity of providing all citi-
zens with the knowledge and critical thinking skills necessary to actively 
engage as informed and discerning agents in a societal landscape where 
AI advancements are permeating is what gives acculturation to AI its 
importance. In line with the broader goal of acculturating citizens to 
AI, there are initiatives such as Terra Numerica and the Maison de 
l’Intelligence Artiﬁcielle (MIA), the “house” of AI, in Sophia Antipolis 
in France. 

Different OECD countries have developed initiatives oriented toward 
the general public, including massive open online courses (MOOCs), 
outreach activities at different moments of the year, and also activities 
such as expositions. To identify the different initiatives, the OECD.ai 
repository integrates an important number of initiatives at the govern-
mental level, ﬁnancial support, and organizations. Among these initia-
tives, some OECD countries have speciﬁcally addressed citizen accultur-
ation, formal education, and information education. OECD.AI serves as 
a global hub for AI policy, offering freely accessible tools and resources 
to all stakeholders. With a focus on AI risks, accountability, potential

futures, incident tracking, and the environmental impact of AI, it collab-
oratively engages a diverse network of over 250 experts to inform policy 
responses and create a comprehensive platform for AI policymakers 
worldwide. 

At the school level, different initiatives have emerged in the last few 
years to support the introduction of AI fundamentals to learners in 
primary and secondary education. These initiatives sometimes emerge 
from the teachers’ initiative, but in other cases, they are promoted 
through Ministry of Education initiatives. The review of Schiff (2022) 
identiﬁed 30 countries that have issued national artiﬁcial intelligence 
(AI) policy strategies outlining plans and expectations for AI’s. He eval-
uates 24 of these strategies concerning the educational sector. Schiff 
(2022) observes that discussions regarding the use of AI in education 
are mostly instrumental, focused on developing an AI-ready workforce 
instead of considering AI’s ethical and societal impact. 

In 2023, the National Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) Strategy and the 
EdTech Masterplan 2030, as outlined by the Singaporean Ministry of 
Education (MOE), advocated for the integration of an adaptive learning 
system to support mathematics education. The system will also feature 
learning 
a Language Feedback Assistant for English to support the 
process by allowing the teacher to focus on the complex tasks and 
activities associated with teaching. In India, the “AI for All” initiative 
proposes an online program for citizens with the goal of demystify AI. 
The U.S. Department of Education Ofﬁce of Educational Technology’s 
recent policy report, “Artiﬁcial Intelligence and the Future of Teaching 
and Learning: Insights and Recommendations” (Cardona et al., 2023) 
emphasizes the imperative to disseminate knowledge, involve educators, 
and enhance technology plans and policies regarding AI in education. 
The report deﬁnes AI as a swiftly advancing technology for pattern 
recognition and automation, guiding educators on how to 
leverage 
these technologies to achieve educational objectives while assessing and 
mitigating any associated risks. 

At the university level, initiatives such as EFELIA, or the “Ecole 
Française de l’IA” (French School of AI), have facilitated the develop-
ment of student accessible courses to support the development of AI 
fundamentals across various domains. The modules cover AI’s role in the

78

M. Romero et al.

humanities, linguistics, and social sciences emphasizing image and text 
analysis. Additionally, the program explores AI’s impact on cultural and 
creative industries, its role in applied foreign languages, and its appli-
cations within healthcare ecosystems and biology. The EFELIA course 
delves into the intersection of AI with law, administration, and public 
service, addressing the associated challenges of AI’s use in these disci-
plines. A speciﬁc course on AI for school teachers spans primary, middle, 
and secondary education levels, offering insights into integrating AI into 
educational practices. The series also includes a module focused on AI in 
adult education, reﬂecting the diverse applications and implications of 
AI across various use cases. 

In the European context, outreach initiatives to facilitate the accultur-
ation of citizens to artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) encompass a multifaceted 
approach. Educational workshops and training programs conduct hands-
on sessions across cities, enabling citizens to actively engage with AI 
applications and participate in discussions emphasizing responsible AI 
use. Public awareness campaigns, such as the European Commission’s 
“AI Watch”1 utilize social media platforms to disseminate information 
about ongoing AI developments and share the AI policies of different 
European countries. Community engagement events, like AI meetups, 
provide forums for citizens to interact with local AI experts, fostering 
dialogues on AI’s impact on daily life. Online platforms, exempliﬁed 
by the website “AI4Good”2 , offer easily accessible resources, including 
videos and articles, to demystify AI concepts and broaden citizens’ 
understanding. Partnerships between AI industry 
leaders and educa-
tional institutions result in AI-focused educational programs, ensuring 
students are equipped with essential AI knowledge. In France, the PIA 
program, supported by the Ministry of Education, has supported compa-
nies such as EvidenceB to develop math (AdaptivMaths 3 ) and language 
learning platforms (AdaptivLangue)4 integrating AI technologies. Initia-
tives such as AI hackathons encourage citizens to collaboratively develop

AI solutions addressing societal challenges, promoting creativity and 
developing problem-solving skills. Policy advocacy forums, such as the AI 
Observatory (OBVIA5 ) create spaces for policymakers, industry leaders, 
and citizens to collaboratively shape AI policies based on public input. 
Collaborations with NGOs ensure a diverse range of voices are included 
in AI discussions, emphasizing societal impacts and ethical considera-
tions. Multilingual outreach strategies, employed by the European AI 
Alliance,6 ensure that information about AI is accessible to citizens 
across language barriers. Lastly, the European Commission’s guidelines 
on the ethics of AI in education provides recommendations for educators 
and parents alike on responsible AI use in educational settings (Euro-
pean Commission, Directorate-General for Education, Youth, Sport and 
Culture, 2022). Collectively, these initiatives represent a proactive and 
diverse approach across Europe to engage citizens in understanding, 
discussing, and shaping the societal impact of AI. 

AI Acculturation in the House of Artificial 
Intelligence 

Third places have the potential to facilitate a broad spectrum of AI activ-
ities. Developed with the goal of acculturating the general public to AI 
and serving as a hub for start-ups and upscaling initiatives, the Maison 
de l’Intelligence Artiﬁcielle (MIA) is an ambitious third-place project 
open to everyone. MIA’s activities are 
inclusive, welcoming kinder-
garten to-high school aged learners, teachers, families, and professionals 
from diverse domains, with the overarching aim of fostering a deeper 
understanding of AI. 

According to MIA director, Ms. Isabelle Galy, the primary concern 
associated with AI acculturation is the possible proliferation of misun-
derstandings among the younger participants. Speciﬁc AI educational 
activities use robots to illustrate AI concepts or emphasize algorithms 
and data. Instances where intelligence is personiﬁed in representations

80

M. Romero et al.

involving robotics frequently foster erroneous expectations regarding the 
capabilities of AI and frequently correspond with science ﬁction narra-
tives. Likewise, an overemphasis on algorithms and data alone may result 
in overly digital illustrations, potentially blurring the distinction between 
digital tools and AI for learners. Such misrepresentation can create biases 
that will be difﬁcult to rectify later in their education. In order to 
address this, it is critical to implement a multiperspective approach 
to AI acculturation. This strategy should incorporate machine learning 
methodologies and the computational modeling components of artiﬁcial 
intelligence across a range of AI technologies and use case illustrations. 
The purpose of this all-encompassing approach is to provide partici-
pants with a nuanced comprehension of AI and prevent the formation 
of erroneous perceptions. 

One of the proposed activities at the MIA is the use of generative 
AI, exempliﬁed by ChatGPT, which has proven effective 
in exam-
ining how AI forms a representation of the world through an encoder 
and how it reproduces the generated world through a decoder. This 
technology enables a multi-approach pedagogy based on deﬁnition, 
researcher works, technology, engineering, outcomes, and human under-
standing. An additional noteworthy aspect of the MIA is the exhi-
bition of AI-focused companies. French industrial ecosystem start-ups 
and AI companies exhibit their technologies at these demonstrations, 
with an emphasis on the necessity to improve the comprehensibility of 
information for end-users. These showcases promote a dialogue-based 
comprehension of AI technologies developed by national companies 
among end-users (including professionals, students, and teachers) of 
diverse ages and backgrounds, thereby providing substantial advantages 
for both parties involved. The MIA beneﬁts from a highly signiﬁcant 
scientiﬁc and technological environment. The French Riviera is an AI 
hub, and AI-producing companies, research laboratories, and the 3IA 
create educational demonstrators to assist young learners in forming a 
genuine understanding of what AI is and to comprehend its importance 
in their studies of mathematics and language proﬁciency. Furthermore, 
this aspect highlights the possibility that organizations situated in various 
nations could create AI-driven technologies that are customized to meet 
particular cultural requirements.

Within the diverse array of activities offered, the Arc-en-ciel project 
(2020–2023), spearheaded by MIA, in collaboration with Université 
Côte d’Azur, Alpes-Maritimes Department, INRIA, Academie de Nice 
and CNRS, is dedicated to fostering awareness of artiﬁcial intelligence 
(AI) among middle school students in the French Riviera. This initia-
tive encompasses four pivotal projects: educational activities at the MIA, 
school or extracurricular internships, addressing biases and gender stereo-
types 
in AI, and activities conducted beyond the walls within the 
departmental territory. The chapter provides a comprehensive explo-
ration of both the achievements and the extensive partnerships that 
facilitated them. Simultaneously, the SMART Deal project, managed by 
MIA in Sophia Antipolis is committed to supporting digital transforma-
tion. This initiative aims to raise AI awareness in middle school students 
over three years, emphasizing practical AI education, dispelling miscon-
ceptions, and offering mentorship to highlight potential study pathways 
and career opportunities in the ﬁeld of AI. This chapter presents the 
achievements of the Arc-en-ciel project, including the organization of 
school and extracurricular 
internships, visits to the MIA by school 
groups, and scientiﬁc mediation activities carried out directly in French 
Rivera’s middle schools. It also provides context around the founding of 
the project, describing the various partnerships and agreements that led 
to the opening of the MIA in 2020, its mission, and the collaborations 
it maintains with the Université Côte d’Azur, mainly on questions of 
teaching AI and gender equity, and through the collaboration of partners 
such as AlterEgaux.

The outreach curriculum 
activities, including AI use case demonstrations at the MIA, school 
visits, extracurricular internships, and training provided by the Regional 
Academic Delegation for Digital Education (DRANE) in collabora-
tion with the MIA. The MIA mediation team, in consultation with

82

M. Romero et al.

grade-level teachers and the target audience, meticulously selects scien-
tiﬁc and cultural activities. Prioritizing effective communication, the 
team considers primary and secondary messages, audience, AI tech-
niques, required participants, and logistical details such as equipment 
weight should there be a need for transportation. Currently undergoing 
a trial and reﬁnement phase, these activities aim to enhance effectiveness 
and broaden outreach. This approach highlights the project’s dedica-
tion to tailoring AI education outreach to middle school students and 
teachers. Additionally, training was provided on-site to 30 teachers in 
collaboration with Terra Numerica. Another initiative, Teacher Wednes-
days, supports in-service AI acculturation and allows teachers to explore 
diverse AI applications in education. 

Entrepreneurship in the Age of AI 

The objective of this project is to equip students with entrepreneurial 
skills. Speciﬁcally, it seeks to develop student agency in an environment 
increasingly inﬂuenced by AI, enabling them to transform their envi-
ronment (Engeström & Sannino, 2013). In this way, students assume 
the role of creators, innovating with digital technology and AI, rather 
than merely consuming AI tools. Students are encouraged to “take 
charge” with the understanding that they can actively contribute to AI’s 
evolution by acknowledging interests, confronting fears or beliefs, and 
addressing any apprehensions about its foundational use. This approach 
also develops student representations (Ghotbi & Ho, 2021). 

The “Entrepreneurship in the Age of AI” project, offered during the 
ﬁnal year of middle school, includes observation and extracurricular 
internships. Observational internships pair participants with companies 
to observe AI use cases and explore potential career paths. Week-long 
extracurricular courses during holidays involve large-scale AI projects, 
incorporating kinesthetic experiments, unplugged algorithmic activities, 
and ideation challenges with design thinking principles. Participants 
tackle problems like “How can AI assist in sports?” or “How can AI 
contribute to managing energy consumption?” by creating empathy 
maps and prototypes using LEGO blocks or digital tools. The week

Gender Perspectives in the Acculturation to AI 

The technology ﬁeld, and AI in particular, is signiﬁcantly impacted 
by gender stereotyping and bias (Franzoni, 2023; Marinucci et al., 
these challenges and 
2023). The Arc-en-ciel project acknowledges 
aims to catalyze a transformation in attitudes and practices, concur-
rently increasing awareness among educators, mediation specialists, and 
students regarding the consequences of gender bias in AI. For instance, 
Norouzi et al. (2020) found that girls exhibited less conﬁdence than 
boys in computer programming skills during an AI initiation project. 
In response to these persistent stereotypes, a collaboration between 
members of the French Rivera Diversity Club and the AlterEgaux orga-
nization initiated a project with three main objectives: creating a digital 
handbook, conducting studies on gender bias in mixed groups, and 
organizing intervention classes for International Women’s Rights Day. 

The digital handbook, a thirty-page guide, invites participants to 
identify gender stereotypes and question their prejudices through short 
educational activities. The second objective involved studies in partner-
ship with the LINE lab at the Université Côte d’Azur and AlterEgaux. 
Data was collected through feedback mechanisms including student 
questionnaires, observations during mediation activities, and an inter-
active game titled “Diversity in AI professions” offered to participants of 
extracurricular internships. Preliminary ﬁndings noted boys’ tendency to 
monopolize speech and attention in mixed groups, often at the expense 
of their female counterparts. A similar phenomenon was observed in 
other MIA interventions, accentuated by a lack of examples modeling 
gender equality, the absence of epicene language, and a dearth of female 
role models. Boys often positioned themselves at the front of the room, 
demonstrating a heightened interest in the subject matter even before 
sessions commenced. Facilitators also observed that their interventions 
impact on boys’ outcomes than on girls, 
had a more pronounced 
regardless of the facilitator’s gender.

84

M. Romero et al.

The third objective involved classes organized by MIA, AlterEgaux, 
and the Women Hacker Action Tank (WHAT06) to discuss diversity 
in science and career pathways in digital and AI-integrated ﬁelds. Held 
in conjunction with International Women’s Rights Day, these classes 
provided participants with the opportunity to meet inspiring female role 
models and engage in roundtable discussions focused on breaking down 
barriers for women in technology. These classes, and the meaningful 
connections they inspired, demonstrate that values such as cooperation, 
ﬂexibility, perseverance, analysis, organization, creativity, leadership, and 
precision transcend gender boundaries. 

The Smart Hive Interdisciplinary Project 

the IAckathon, students actively participated 

As part of the Fête de la Science celebration, MIA presented various 
activities, notably an AI hackathon aimed at crafting a smart hive. 
in a design 
Dubbed 
thinking approach to formulate an AI-based solution. The outcomes 
of this event, with involvement from college FabLabs responding to 
a call from the Regional Academic Directorate for Digital Education 
(DRANE), were showcased at the World AI Cannes Festival (Fig. 6.1).
The IAckathon aimed to execute an interdisciplinary project, seam-
lessly integrating AI while aligning with the sustainability objective. The 
theme of the intelligent hive was chosen for its promise to span various 
disciplines, extending beyond scientiﬁc subjects. Sustainable develop-
ment was addressed through perspectives such as biodiversity preserva-
tion and resource conservation via edge computing (Shi et al., 2016). 
During the event, students from four Alpes-Maritimes middle schools 
made substantial contributions including participating in an interdis-
ciplinary exploration of smart hives, where they collaborated closely 
with a beekeeper and conducted hands-on experiments with IoT sensors 
for data acquisition. Their activities included optimizing sensor place-
ment, analyzing energy requirements, and exploring machine learning 
applications to enhance understanding of bee colony activities.

A Regional Ecosystem for Supporting AI 
Acculturation 

Establishing a regional ecosystem for fostering AI acculturation, the MIA 
actively collaborates with various stakeholders in scientiﬁc, technical, 
and industrial sectors. This collaborative approach allows stakeholders 
to share their perspectives, collectively raising awareness among students 
through local, national, and international initiatives. The overarching 
goal is to enhance the methods of educational mediation through this 
collaborative effort. 

Over the past years, Terra Numerica and the MIA have under-
taken educational interventions within the Arc-en-ciel project. These 
endeavors focus on highlighting the impact of AI use cases and providing 
the necessary resources and pedagogical training to demystify AI appli-
cations. Supported by institutional, academic, and industrial partners, 
these activities align with the MIA’s comprehensive, multidisciplinary 
approach to AI. Themes like culture, territory, and daily life enhance 
use cases by grounding them in real-world scenarios. The Arc-en-ciel 
project, through its four initiatives, is committed to educating secondary

86

M. Romero et al.

school students in the Alpes-Maritimes department on the use and impli-
cations of AI. Further initiatives, including participation in events like 
the Science Festival and Brain Week, aim to move beyond school age 
students to enhance digital literacy for all residents of the department. 

Discussion 

The dynamic landscape of AI acculturation shows different initiatives at 
the regional and international level. Among these initiatives, the House 
of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (MIA) is an important initiative in the accul-
turation of AI for a large number of stakeholders including students 
and their teachers, but also the AI industrial ecosystem. Projects such 
as ‘Entrepreneurship in the Age of AI’ and the IAhackatons serve to 
empower students not only as users of AI, but as active contributors to its 
transformative journey through interdisciplinary collaboration, sustain-
ability goals, and the integration of AI into diverse citizenship challenges. 
The chapter concludes by underscoring the 
importance of regional 
ecosystems, emphasizing the MIA’s collaborative efforts with Terra 
Numerica and other stakeholders, shaping an inclusive and enriching 
educational experience for students and promoting collaboration within 
the French Rivera’s AI ecosystem. Within the different initiatives, we aim 
to highlight the gender perspectives, tackled through strategic projects 
and interventions, exemplify a commitment to fostering inclusivity, and 
dismantling biases in the AI domain. The continued consideration of 
the gender perspective should be stressed not only at regional levels but 
also at the international level to ensure the development of AI technolo-
gies that reduce gender bias and promote human–AI collaboration for a 
diverse group of users.
