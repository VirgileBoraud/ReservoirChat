Abstract Neurostimulation of the hippocampal formation has shown
promising results for modulating memory but the underlying mechanisms
remain unclear. In particular, the effects on hippocampal theta-nested
gamma oscillations and theta phase reset, which are both crucial for
memory processes, are unknown. Moreover, these effects cannot be
investigated using current computational models, which consider theta
oscillations with a ﬁxed amplitude and phase velocity. Here, we
developed a novel computational model that includes the medial septum,
represented as a set of abstract Kuramoto oscillators producing a
dynamical theta rhythm with phase reset, and the hippocampal formation,
composed of biophysically-realistic neurons and able to generate
theta-nested gamma oscillations under theta drive. We showed that, for
theta inputs just below the threshold to induce self-sustained
theta-nested gamma oscillations, a single stimulation pulse could switch
the network behavior from non-oscillatory to a state producing sustained
oscillations. Next, we demonstrated that, for a weaker theta input,
pulse train stimulation at the theta frequency could transiently restore
seemingly physiological oscillations. Importantly, the presence of phase
reset inﬂuenced whether these two effects depended on the phase at which
stimulation onset was delivered, which has practical implications for
designing neurostimulation protocols that are triggered by the phase of
ongoing theta oscillations. This novel model opens new avenues for
studying the effects of neurostimulation on the hippocampal formation.
Furthermore, our hybrid approach that combines different levels of
abstraction could be extended in future work to other neural circuits
that produce dynamical brain rhythms.

Introduction Neurostimulation methods have emerged as promising
therapeutic modalities to restore neuro- logical functions in a broad
range of motor and cognitive disorders (Gupta et al., 2023). In the
context of learning and memory, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the
entorhinal area or hippocam- pus has been shown to either enhance
(Suthana et al., 2012; Suthana and Fried, 2014; Titiz et al., 2017; Jun
et al., 2019) or disrupt (Jacobs et al., 2016; Goyal et al., 2018;
Lozano et al., 2016) memory encoding. These conﬂicting results may
originate from differences in experimental protocols and from a poor
understanding of their biophysical underpinnings. Among such mechanisms,
the in-

volvement of hippocampal theta oscillations (4-12 Hz) and their
interactions with higher-frequency gamma oscillations (30-120 Hz) in
memory-related processes has been reported in multiple studies (Lisman
et al., 2005; de Almeida et al., 2007; Lega et al., 2012; Lin et al.,
2017; Malkov et al., 2022; Abbaspoor et al., 2023). Moreover, the
modulation of gamma oscillations by the phase of theta os- cillations in
hippocampal circuits, a phenomenon termed theta-gamma phase-amplitude
coupling (PAC), correlates with the eﬃcacy of memory encoding and
retrieval (Jensen and Colgin, 2007; Tort et al., 2009; Canolty and
Knight, 2010; Axmacher et al., 2010; Fell and Axmacher, 2011; Lisman and
Jensen, 2013; Lega et al., 2016). Experimental and computational work on
the coupling between oscillatory rhythms has indicated that it
originates from different neural architectures and corre- lates with a
range of behavioral and cognitive functions, enabling the long-range
synchronization of cortical areas and facilitating multi-item encoding
in the context of memory (Hyaﬁl et al., 2015). Neurostimulation
protocols that affect these rhythms, such as theta burst stimulation
(Titiz et al., 2017), have also been shown to optimally induce long-term
potentiation (LTP) (Larson and Munkácsy, 2015). Another potential
mechanism underlying the effect of hippocampal neurostim- ulation might
be the reset of the phase of theta oscillations in response to exogenous
inputs, such as a novel sensory input or a pulse of electrical
stimulation applied to the fornix or perforant path (Buño et al., 1978;
Williams and Givens, 2003). Theta phase reset is known to facilitate LTP
(McCart- ney et al., 2004) and naturally occurs during both encoding and
retrieval of associative memories (Kota et al., 2020). In this context,
the design of a computational model that replicates memory- related
theta-gamma oscillations and theta phase reset is of uttermost
importance to investigate the effects of electrical stimulation on the
hippocampal formation and possibly optimize neurostim- ulation protocols
for memory improvement.

Models of memory-related theta-gamma oscillations in the hippocampal
formation have been developed across different resolution levels,
ranging from abstract mean-ﬁeld approaches (Traub et al., 1997; Onslow
et al., 2014; Segneri et al., 2020) to biophysically-realistic
conductance-based models (Lundqvist et al., 2006; Herman et al., 2013;
Aussel et al., 2018). Neural masses, which represent the mean activity
of a neuronal population, can generate gamma oscillations through
reciprocal interactions between an excitatory and inhibitory population
(Traub et al., 1997; Onslow et al., 2014), or even using a
self-projecting inhibitory population (Segneri et al., 2020). Under
exci- tatory oscillatory input at theta frequencies, these models are
capable of generating theta-nested gamma oscillations. Similarly, these
oscillations can be observed in more complex models of the hippocampal
formation composed of single-compartment excitatory and inhibitory
neurons con- nected through conductance-based synapses following the
Hodgkin-Huxley formalism (Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952), and driven by a
ﬁxed oscillatory theta input (Aussel et al., 2018). Theta-nested gamma
oscillations also appear in multi-compartment models of prefrontal
cortex activity during memory retrieval (Lundqvist et al., 2006; Herman
et al., 2013). Finally, several models have inves- tigated the
functional link between the hippocampal theta rhythm and memory
processes, show- ing that encoding and retrieval occur at different
phases within each theta cycle through phasic changes in neuronal
activity and LTP (e.g., Hasselmo et al. (2002); Cutsuridis et
al. (2010)).

In terms of neurostimulation, most computational work has focused on the
mechanisms under- lying DBS of the basal ganglia for motor disorders
such as Parkinson’s disease (Rubin and Terman, 2004; Pirini et al.,
2009; Mina et al., 2013; Ebert et al., 2014), peripheral nerve
stimulation (Rattay et al., 2003; Kipping and Nogueira, 2022), spinal
cord stimulation (Rattay et al., 2000; Capogrosso et al., 2013), or has
remained generic (Basu et al., 2018). However, models investigating
neurostim- ulation of hippocampal circuits are scarce (Hendrickson et
al., 2016; Bingham et al., 2018), and do not take into account the
effects on theta-gamma oscillations. For example, a detailed multicom-
partment model of the rat dentate gyrus was able to replicate
experimentally recorded local ﬁeld potentials induced by different
electrode placements and pulse amplitudes during stimulation of the
perforant path (Bingham et al., 2018). To model the impact of
neurostimulation on neuronal oscillations, a more abstract formalism
based on Kuramoto phase oscillators (Kuramoto, 1984) has been introduced
in the context of Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor, which
enabled the de-

sign of novel neurostimulation paradigms that enhance or disrupt
neuronal synchrony in basal ganglia circuits (Tass, 2003; Ebert et al.,
2014; Asllani et al., 2018; Weerasinghe et al., 2019).

To our knowledge, there is currently no model of the hippocampal
formation that is able to replicate both theta-gamma PAC and theta phase
reset during neurostimulation. To investigate the effects of
neurostimulation on hippocampal circuits while taking into account these
two mech- anisms, we modiﬁed an existing biophysical model of the
hippocampal formation (Aussel et al., 2018). In this original model,
however, the theta rhythm was considered as an oscillatory input of ﬁxed
amplitude and phase velocity, which is inconsistent with theta phase
reset. To circumvent this limitation, we combined this biophysical model
with abstract Kuramoto oscillators that acted as a dynamical source of
theta rhythm, thereby modeling medial septum inputs to the hippocampal
for- mation. This new hybrid dynamical model could generate both
theta-nested gamma oscillations and theta phase reset, following a
particular phase response curve (PRC) inspired by experimental
literature (Lengyel et al., 2005; Akam et al., 2012; Torben-Nielsen et
al., 2010).

We then leveraged this model to explore the effect of single-pulse and
pulse-train stimulation on theta-gamma oscillations. In the absence of
theta input from the medial septum, single-pulse stimulation produced a
transient effect consisting of one or several bursts of activity,
depending on stimulation amplitude. The presence of multiple bursts
depended on the single-cell calcium dy- namics and M-type potassium
adaptation current. In the presence of weak theta input, designed to
mimic a pathological state that impairs theta-gamma oscillations,
single-pulse stimulation could produce long-lasting or even persistent
activity by switching the network to a highly synchronized state
characterized by theta-nested gamma oscillations. When phase reset was
not included in the model, this effect was more pronounced when the
stimulation pulse was delivered at the peak of the theta rhythm.
However, when strong theta reset was considered, the phase at which
stimula- tion was delivered did not inﬂuence the outcome. In the
presence of an even weaker theta input, mimicking a pathological state
that completely abolishes theta-gamma oscillations, only pulse train
stimulation could restore physiological theta-gamma oscillations during
the stimulation period. As for the previous results, this effect was
phase-dependent only when theta reset was not included. These results
provide a new framework to interpret neurostimulation interventions that
inter- fere with hippocampal oscillations and aim at improving memory
function. It can be further ex- tended to investigate the effects of
more complex neurostimulation protocols, and the impact of stimulation
location and amplitude on the observed network dynamics.

Results

A computational model of the hippocampal formation with dynamical theta
input We ﬁrst developed a computational model of hippocampal circuits,
able to generate both theta- nested gamma oscillations and theta phase
reset. To achieve this, we combined an existing con- ductance-based
model of the hippocampal formation (Aussel et al., 2018) with a set of
Kuramoto phase oscillators (Kuramoto, 1984) that were used to model the
dynamical theta input originating from pacemaker neurons in the medial
septum (Wang, 2002) (Figure 1A). Such ensembles of os- cillators are
designed to exhibit a strong phase reset of their collective rhythm in
response to a perturbation (Levnajić and Pikovsky, 2010). The
hippocampal model contained excitatory and in- hibitory neuronal
populations in the entorhinal cortex (EC), dentate gyrus (DG), CA3 and
CA1 ﬁelds within a coronal slice of the human hippocampus (Figure 1B-C).
The output of the hippocampal formation (i.e., the activity of CA1
pyramidal neurons) was provided as an input to the Kuramoto oscillators,
simulating the hippocampal-septal projections through the fornix
(Williams and Givens, 2003; Nuñez and Buño, 2021; Takeuchi et al.,
2021). The oscillations produced by the collective be- havior of
Kuramoto oscillators represented a population average of their activity:
highly synchro- nized and desynchronized states generated respectively
high and low amplitude theta oscillations (Figure 1D). The number of
oscillators was chosen so that their synchronization level (i.e., their
or- der parameter) and their frequency distribution were suﬃciently
close to their asymptotic behavior

for a large number of oscillators (Figure S1).

Biologically, GABAergic neurons from the medial septum project to the
EC, CA3, and CA1 ﬁelds of the hippocampus (Toth et al., 1993; Hajós et
al., 2004; Manseau et al., 2008; Hangya et al., 2009; Unal et al., 2015;
Müller and Remy, 2018). Although the respective roles of these different
pro- jections are not fully understood, previous computational studies
have suggested that the direct projection from the medial septum to CA1
is not essential for the production of theta in CA1 micro- circuits
(Mysin et al., 2019). Since our modeling of the medial septum is only
used to generate a dynamic theta rhythm, we opted for a simpliﬁed
representation where the medial septum projects only to the EC, which in
turn drives the different subﬁelds of the hippocampus. In our model, Ku-
ramoto oscillators are therefore connected to the EC neurons and they
receive projections from CA1 neurons (see methods for more details).

From a conceptual point of view, our model is thus composed of
excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) cir- cuits connected in series, with a
feedback loop going through a population of coupled phase oscil- lators.
In the next sections, we ﬁrst describe the generation of gamma
oscillations by individual E-I circuits (Figure 2), and illustrate their
behavior when driven by an oscillatory input such as theta oscillations
(Figure 3). We then present a thorough characterization of the effects
of theta input and stimulation amplitude on theta-nested gamma
oscillations (Figure 4 and Figure 5). Finally, we present some results
on the effects of neurostimulation protocols for restoring theta-nested
gamma oscillations in pathological states (Figure 6 and Figure 7).

Generation of gamma oscillations by E-I circuits It is well-established
that a network of interconnected pyramidal neurons and interneurons can
give rise to oscillations in the gamma range, a mechanism termed
pyramidal-interneuronal net- work gamma (PING) (Traub et al., 2004;
Onslow et al., 2014; Segneri et al., 2020). This mechanism has been
observed in several optogenetic studies with gradually increasing light
intensity (i.e., un- der a ramp input) affecting multiple different
circuits, such as layer 2-3 pyramidal neurons of the mouse somatosensory
cortex (Adesnik and Scanziani, 2010), the CA3 ﬁeld of the hippocampus in
rat in vitro slices (Akam et al., 2012), and in the non-human primate
motor cortex (Lu et al., 2015). In all cases, gamma oscillations emerged
above a certain threshold in terms of photostimulation intensity, and
the frequency of these oscillations was either stable or slightly
increased when in- creasing the intensity further. We sought to
replicate these ﬁndings with our elementary E-I circuits composed of
single-compartment conductance-based neurons driven by a ramping input
current (Figure 2 and Figure S2). As an example, all the results in this
section will be shown for an E-I cir- cuit that has similar connectivity
parameters as the CA1 ﬁeld of the hippocampus in our complete model (see
section “Hippocampal formation: inputs and connectivity” in the
methods).

For low input currents provided to both neuronal populations, only the
highly-excitable in- terneurons were activated (Figure 2A). For a
suﬃciently high input current (i.e., a strong input that could overcome
the inhibition from the fast-spiking interneurons), the pyramidal
neurons started spiking as well. As the amplitude of the input
increased, the activity of the both neuronal popu- lations became
synchronized in the gamma range, asymptotically reaching a frequency of
about 60 Hz (Figure 2A bottom panel). Decoupling the populations led to
the abolition of gamma oscil- lations (Figure 2B), as neuronal activity
was determined solely by the intrinsic properties of each cell.
Interestingly, when the ramp input was provided solely to the excitatory
population, we ob- served that the activity of the pyramidal neurons
preceded the activity of the inhibitory neurons, while still preserving
the emergence of gamma oscillations (Figure S2A). As expected,
decoupling the populations also abolished gamma oscillations, with the
excitatory neurons spiking a frequency determined by their intrinsic
properties and the inhibitory population remaining silent (Figure S2B).
To further characterize the intrinsic properties of individual
inhibitory and excitatory neurons, we derived their input-frequency
(I-F) curves, which represent the ﬁring rate of individual neurons in
response to a tonic input (Figure S3A). We observed that for certain
input amplitudes, the ﬁr- ing rates of both types of neurons was within
the gamma range. Interestingly, in the absence of

noise, each population could generate by itself gamma oscillations that
were purely driven by the input and determined by the intrinsic
properties of the neurons (Figure S3B). Adding stochastic Gaussian noise
in the membrane potential disrupted these artiﬁcial oscillations in
decoupled pop- ulations (Figure S3C). All subsequent simulations were
run with similar noise levels to prevent the emergence of artiﬁcial
gamma oscillations.

Another potent way to induce gamma oscillations is to drive fast-spiking
inhibitory neurons using pulsed optogenetic stimulation at gamma
frequencies, a strategy that has been used both in the neocortex (Cardin
et al., 2009) and hippocampal CA1 (Iaccarino et al., 2016). In
particular, Cardin and colleagues systematically investigated the effect
of driving either excitatory or fast- spiking inhibitory neocortical
neurons at frequencies between 10 and 200 Hz (Cardin et al., 2009). They
showed that fast-spiking interneurons are preferentially entrained
around 40-50 Hz, while ex- citatory neurons respond better to lower
frequencies. To verify the behavior of our model against these
experimental data, we simulated pulsed optogenetic stimulation as an
intracellular current provided to our reduced model of a single E-I
circuit. Stimulation was applied at frequencies be- tween 10 and 200 Hz
to excitatory cells only, to inhibitory cells only, or to both at the
same time (Figure S4). The population ﬁring rates were used as a proxy
for the local ﬁeld potentials (LFP), and we computed the relative power
in a 10-Hz band centered around the stimulation frequency, simi- larly
to the method proposed in (Cardin et al., 2009). When presented with
continuous stimulation across a range of frequencies in the gamma range,
interneurons showed the greatest degree of gamma power modulation
(Figure S4). Furthermore, when the stimulation was delivered to the ex-
citatory population, the relative power around the stimulation frequency
dropped signiﬁcantly in frequencies above 10 Hz, similar to the reported
experimental data (Cardin et al., 2009). The main difference between our
simulation results and these experimental data is the speciﬁc
frequencies at which fast-spiking interneurons showed resonance, which
was around 40 Hz in the mouse barrel cortex and around 90 Hz in our
model, a fast gamma rhythm. This could be attributed to several fac-
tors, such as differences in the cellular properties between cortical
and hippocampal fast-spiking interneurons, or the differences between
the size of the populations and their relevant connectivity in the
cortex and the hippocampus.

Theta-gamma oscillations and theta phase reset under dynamical theta
input Once we validated that our elementary E-I circuits were able to
generate gamma oscillations under an input of suﬃciently high amplitude,
we studied the behavior of the whole model when the theta input was
dynamically provided by the Kuramoto oscillators as described above
(Figure 1). As in the original model (Aussel et al., 2018), the input
theta rhythm drove the network to produce spiking activity in the gamma
range preferentially around the peak of theta in all excitatory and
inhibitory populations (Figure 3A and Figure S5). Spectrograms of the
CA1 population ﬁring rates revealed that these bursts of activity around
each theta peak were characterized by oscillations around 60 Hz (Figure
3A). This was conﬁrmed by power spectral densities, which showed a clear
peak at 4 Hz (corresponding to the theta drive) and increases in gamma
band activity between 40 and 80 Hz (Figure 3B). To quantify PAC between
theta and gamma oscillations, we used the modulation index (MI) (Tort et
al., 2008, 2010), which has been shown to outperform other similar
measures (Hülsemann et al., 2019). However, we discovered that this
metric would give erroneous results in our simulated datasets due to the
absence of certain frequency components. To overcome this limitation and
avoid artifacts, uniform noise was added to the ﬁring rates prior to
computing the MI (Figure S6). We ﬁrst visualized the quantiﬁcation of
PAC using the comodulogram, which indicates the MI as a function of two
frequencies corresponding to the modulating phase signal and the
modulated amplitude signal. This analysis conﬁrmed that gamma-band
signals between 45 and 75 Hz were modulated by lower theta frequencies
between 3 and 6 Hz, which we quantiﬁed by computing a global MI in
frequency ranges encompassing theta (3-9 Hz) and gamma (40-80 Hz)
(Figure S5B). To reﬁne this analysis, we also computed a similar MI
between the amplitude of various gamma frequencies and the phase of
theta, which indicated that oscillations between 40

and 80 Hz occur preferentially around the peak of theta (Figure 3C and
Figure S5B).

Next, we veriﬁed that our model was able to display theta phase reset
during single-pulse stim- ulation (depolarizing pulse, 1-ms duration).
This mechanism is tightly linked with the concept of PRC, which
characterizes the phase delay or advancement that follows a single pulse
delivered to an oscillatory system, as a function of the phase at which
this input is delivered. Although there is no direct measurement of the
PRC of septal neurons, such characterizations have been per- formed for
individual pyramidal cells in the CA3 and CA1 ﬁelds of the hippocampus
(Lengyel et al., 2005; Kwag and Paulsen, 2009; Akam et al., 2012). These
PRCs appear biphasic and show a phase advancement (respectively delay)
for stimuli delivered in the ascending (respectively descending) slope
of theta. We modeled this behavior by a speciﬁc term (which we called
the phase response function) in the general equation of the Kuramoto
oscillators (see methods, Equation 1). Impor- tantly, introducing a
phase offset in the phase response function disrupted theta-nested gamma
oscillations (Figure S7), which suggests that the septohippocampal
circuitry must be critically tuned to be able to generate such
oscillations. The strength of phase reset could also be adjusted by a
gain that was manually tuned. In the presence of the physiological phase
response function and of a suﬃciently high reset gain, a single
stimulation pulse delivered to all excitatory and inhibitory CA1 neurons
could reset the phase of theta to a value close to its peaks (Figure
3A). We computed the PRC of our simulated data for different stimulation
amplitudes and validated that our neuronal network behaved according to
the phase response function set in our Kuramoto oscillators (Fig- ure
3D). It should be noted that including this phase reset mechanism
affected the generated theta rhythm even in the absence of stimulation,
extending the duration of the theta peak and thereby slowing down the
frequency of the generated theta rhythm.

Importantly, our approach is generalizable and can be applied to other
models producing theta- nested gamma oscillations. For instance, we
adapted the neural mass model by Onslow and col- leagues (Onslow et al.,
2014), replaced the ﬁxed theta input by a set of Kuramoto oscillators,
and demonstrated that it could also generate theta phase reset in
response to single-pulse stimulation (Figure S8). These results
illustrate that the general behavior of our model is not speciﬁc to the
tuning of individual parameters in the conductance-based neurons, but
follows general rules that are captured by the level of abstraction of
the Kuramoto formalism.

Overall, we successfully developed a new model of the hippocampal
formation able to exhibit both theta-nested gamma oscillations and theta
phase reset in response to stimulation. We then decided to explore
further the effects of various stimulation protocols on its dynamics.

Effects of theta input and stimulation amplitudes on theta-gamma
oscillations We investigated the behavior of the model across multiple
states of varying septal theta input am- plitude in response to
single-pulse stimulation delivered to CA1. In the absence of theta
drive, a single stimulation pulse elicited either zero or two bursts of
spiking activity (depending on stimula- tion amplitude) separated by
about 200 ms (Figure 4A, C). We ﬁrst sought to understand the origin of
this second burst, as it showed that even a single pulse could induce
transient periodic activity around 5 Hz in our model, a frequency within
the theta range. A previous model has shown that the presence of
Calcium-Activated Non-speciﬁc cationic (CAN) currents can lead to
self-sustained theta oscillations in the hippocampus (Giovannini et al.,
2017). Moreover, this study showed a direct link between the increased
excitation provided by the CAN current and the spike-frequency
adaptation properties of the M-current, directly affecting transitions
from an asynchronous low-ﬁring regime to synchronous bursting. We tested
the role of the CAN current in the response to single-pulse stimulation
by completely removing it from our simulations, which abolished the
second burst of activity (Figure 4B). Moreover, the time interval
separating the two bursts likely resulted from the interplay between the
depolarizing CAN current and hyperpolarizing M current (Figure 4A).

In the presence of dynamic theta input, the effects of single-pulse
stimulation depended both on theta input amplitude and stimulation
amplitude, highlighting different regimes of network ac- tivity (Figure
5 and Figure S9, Figure S10, Figure S11). For low theta input,
theta-nested gamma oscil-

lations were initially absent and could not be induced by stimulation
(Figure 5A). At most, the stim- ulation could only elicit a few bursts
of spiking activity that faded away after approximately 250 ms, similar
to the rebound of activity seen in the absence of theta drive. For
increasing theta input, the network switched to an intermediate regime:
upon initialization at a state with no spiking activity, it could be
kicked to a state with self-sustained theta-nested gamma oscillations by
a single stimula- tion pulse of suﬃciently high amplitude (Figure 5B).
This regime existed for a range of septal theta inputs located just
below the threshold to induce self-sustained theta-gamma oscillations
without additional stimulation, as characterized by the post-stimulation
theta power, gamma power, and theta-gamma PAC (Figure 5D). Removing CAN
currents from all areas of the model abolished this behavior Figure S12,
which is interesting given the role of this current in the
multistability of EC neurons (Egorov et al., 2002; Fransén et al., 2006)
and in the intrinsic ability of the hippocampus to generate theta-nested
gamma oscillations (Giovannini et al., 2017). For the highest theta
input, the network became able to spontaneously generate theta-nested
gamma oscillations, even when initialized at a state with no spiking
activity and without additional neurostimulation Figure 5C.

Neurostimulation for restoring theta-gamma oscillations in pathological
states Based on the above analyses, we considered two pathological
states: one with a moderate theta in- put (i.e., moderately weak
projections from the medial septum to the EC) that allowed the
initiation of self-sustained oscillations by single stimulation pulses
(Figure 5, point B), and one with a weaker theta input characterized by
the complete absence of self-sustained oscillations even following
transient stimulation (Figure 5, point A). In each case, we sought to
assess whether single-pulse or pulse train stimulation could induce or
restore theta-nested gamma oscillations and whether this effect depended
on the phase at which stimulation was delivered (i.e., at the peak or
trough of the theta cycle). We hypothesized that any possible phase
relationship would also depend on the phase reset mechanism. To test
this hypothesis, we ran a series of simulations using two different
models: one without phase reset and one with strong phase reset (i.e.,
the reset gain was set at the value used in Figure 3).

In the case of a moderate theta input and in the presence of phase
reset, delivering a pulse at either the peak or trough of theta could
induce theta-nested gamma oscillations (Figure 6A and 6C). By contrast,
in the absence of phase reset, only stimulation delivered at the peak of
theta was able to induce such oscillations, after some time delay
(Figure 6B, D). Quantiﬁcation of these results in terms of theta power,
gamma power, and theta-gamma PAC showed strongly similar responses
between stimulation delivered at the peak or trough of theta with phase
reset enabled, similar but weaker responses with stimulation delivered
at the peak of theta with phase reset disabled, and no response in the
case of trough stimulation with phase reset disabled (Figure 6E).

In the case of a weak theta input that completely abolished neuronal
oscillations, we delivered stimulation pulses continuously at a
frequency matching that of the underlying theta rhythm for a duration of
2 s, in order to restore physiological oscillations (Figure 7). The
stimulation onset was timed to either the peak or trough of the ongoing
theta cycle. The continuous delivery of pulses produced similar results
as single-pulse stimulation. With phase reset, pulse train stimulation
re- stored theta-nested gamma oscillations within the whole network,
irrespective of the phase of stimulation onset (Figure 7A, C). Notably,
stimulation delivered at the trough forced a reset of the phase of theta
rhythm and led to the subsequent delivery of pulses at the peak of
theta. Interest- ingly, in the absence of phase reset, peak-targeted
stimulation induced theta-gamma oscillations in all network areas
easily, while trough-targeted stimulation created artiﬁcial bursts that
propa- gated in other areas with diﬃculty, requiring multiple pulses to
achieve a fraction of the results of peak-targeted stimulation (Figure
6B, D). Comparing these simulations based on theta power, gamma power,
and theta-gamma PAC within CA1 (Figure 7E) showed similar albeit less
striking dif- ferences as single-pulse stimulation, possibly because CA1
was driven directly by the stimulation. Notably, gamma power in the
absence of theta phase reset, was higher when utilizing pulse trains.
These differences were even more pronounced in areas other than CA1, as
can be seen by the

Discussion

Highlights In summary, we have developed a novel computational model to
investigate the effects of elec- trical stimulation on a slice of the
hippocampal formation, incorporating two important features related to
memory: theta-nested gamma oscillations and theta phase reset. The key
innovation compared to previous models (e.g., Aussel et al. (2018)) is
the introduction of a set of abstract Ku- ramoto oscillators, which
represent pacemaker neurons in the medial septum and are interfaced with
biophysically realistic neuronal models in the hippocampus. From a
methodological point of view, this hybrid interfacing between two levels
of abstraction represents an innovation in itself and could be applied
to other systems or brain structures that are driven by dynamical
rhythms. The main outcomes reported here relate to the importance of the
theta reset mechanism when examining the effects of neurostimulation on
hippocampal oscillations.

A very interesting ﬁnding concerns the behavior of the model in response
to single-pulse stim- ulation for certain values of the theta amplitude
(Figure 5). For low theta amplitudes, a single stim- ulation pulse was
capable of switching the network behavior from a state with no spiking
activity to one with prominent theta-nested gamma oscillations. Whether
such an effect can be induced in vivo in the context of memory processes
remains an open question. Nevertheless, delivering a single stimulation
pulse bilaterally to the human hippocampus during a memory task is
suﬃcient to impair memory encoding (Lacruz et al., 2010), suggesting
that even single-pulse stimulation can indeed have wide network effects
that are behaviorally relevant.

The second main ﬁnding is that the timing of individual stimulation
pulses with respect to the phase of the ongoing theta rhythm matters
differently depending on the presence or absence of phase reset (Figure
6 and Figure 7). Human intracranial stimulation data indicate that the
re- ceptivity of hippocampal circuits to single-pulse stimulation is
modulated by the phase of theta (Lurie et al., 2022). A number of
studies have also reported conﬂicting results in terms of memory
outcomes, which could potentially be attributed to the induction of
phase reset through stimula- tion (Suthana et al., 2012; Jacobs et al.,
2016). To our knowledge, however, the degree of phase reset that follows
each stimulation pulse remains unknown and should be investigated in
future experimental studies. From a technological point of view, the two
regimes with and without phase reset have opposite predictions
concerning the need for closed-loop stimulation protocols that would
trigger stimulation in real-time based on the phase of ongoing theta
oscillations. Such phase- triggered stimulation would be most useful if
the phase reset mechanism remains relatively limited. When this
mechanism becomes too strong, regular continuous stimulation appears
suﬃcient to restore physiological theta-gamma oscillations (Figure 7).

It should also be noted that the reset gain in our simulations (Equation
1, gain 𝐺𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑡

) was either completely turned off or set at a high value, producing a
strong effect that always reset the phase of theta to its peak. In
reality, the degree of theta phase reset is dynamic, depending on the
en- vironment and associated task requirements (Rizzuto et al., 2003;
Mormann et al., 2005; Jackson et al., 2008), and may be affected by
neurodegenerative disorders that affect the connections be- tween the
hippocampal formation and the medial septum. Importantly, our proposed
framework can simulate intermediate values of the reset gain, which
should ideally be ﬁtted to experimental data in future applications.

Finally, we modeled pathological states by reducing the maximum
amplitude of the theta in- put (Equation 2, gain 𝐺𝜃 ) until theta-nested
gamma oscillations were impaired or even abolished (Figure 5). This
choice was meant to simulate neurodegeneration in the medial septum,
which is known to be affected in Alzheimer’s disease, leading to
oscillatory disruptions (Nelson et al., 2014; Hampel et al., 2018;
Takeuchi et al., 2021). Another possibility would be that
neurodegeneration limits the ability of the septal pacemaker neurons to
synchronize, thus producing a weaker col-

8 of 52

lective theta rhythm without affecting the maximum amplitude of
individual oscillators. Although we simulated this change in our model
by reducing the synchronization parameter, the effects on hippocampal
oscillations were less pronounced (Figure S12). Linking these different
modeling parameters to experimental biomarkers will be important in
future work.

Limitations Even though we took great care in developing a precise
representation of the hippocampal forma- tion, the resulting model
remains a simpliﬁcation that could be further enriched. In particular,
we deliberately modeled only a single theta generator, while multiple
intra- and extra-hippocampal generators are known to co-exist (Kocsis et
al., 1999; Hummos and Nair, 2017). We decided to model septal pacemaker
neurons projecting to the EC as the main source of hippocampal theta as
reported in multiple experimental studies (Buzsáki, 2002; Buzsáki et
al., 2003; Hangya et al., 2009; Colgin, 2013). However, experimental
ﬁndings and previous models have also proposed that direct septal inputs
are not essential for theta generation (Wang, 2002; Colgin, 2013; Mysin
et al., 2019), but play an important role in phase synchronization of
hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, the model does not account for the
connections between the lateral and medial septum and the hip- pocampus
(Takeuchi et al., 2021). These connections include the inhibitory
projections from the lateral to the medial septum and the monosynaptic
projections from the hippocampal CA3 ﬁeld to the lateral septum. An
experimental study has highlighted the importance of the lateral septum
in regulating the hippocampal theta rhythm Bender et al. (2015), an area
that has not been included in the model. Speciﬁcally, theta-rhythmic
optogenetic stimulation of the axonal projections from the lateral
septum to the hippocampus was shown to entrain theta oscillations and
lead to behav- ioral changes during exploration in transgenic mice. To
account for these discrepancies, our model could be extended by
considering more realistic connectivity patterns between the medial /
lateral septum and the hippocampal formation, including glutamatergic,
cholinergic, and GABAergic re- ciprocal connections (Müller and Remy,
2018), or by considering multiple sets of oscillators each representing
one theta generator.

In terms of neuronal cell types, we also made an important simpliﬁcation
by considering only basket cells as the main class of inhibitory
interneuron in the whole hippocampal formation. How- ever, it should be
noted that many other types of interneurons exist in the hippocampus and
have been modeled in various works with higher computational complexity
(e.g., Bezaire et al. (2016); Chatzikalymniou et al. (2021)). Among
these various interneurons, oriens-lacunosum moleculare (OLM) neurons in
the CA1 ﬁeld have been shown to play a crucial role in synchronizing the
activity of pyramidal neurons at gamma frequencies (Tort et al., 2007),
and in generating theta-gamma PAC (e.g., Neymotin et al. (2011); Ponzi
et al. (2023)). Additionally, these cells may contribute to the
formation of speciﬁc phase relationships within CA1 neuronal
populations, through the inte- gration between inputs from the medial
septum, the EC, and CA3 (Mysin et al., 2019). Future work is needed to
include more diverse cell types and detailed morphologies modeled
through multiple compartments.

Another limitation of our model concerns synaptic transmission delays,
which have been largely neglected and could affect the phase
relationships between the medial septum and different hip- pocampal
subﬁelds. Experimental studies have indeed reported time delays in the
population activities of connected anatomical structures (i.e., from EC
to DG) (Mizuseki et al., 2009), with pyra- midal cells in downstream
areas like CA3 and CA1 preferentially ﬁring at different phases of theta
(Dragoi and Buzsáki, 2006). Propagation effects could also depend on the
spatial scale of the model. We also decided to represent only a thin
coronal slice of the hippocampal formation, and it re- mains unclear how
an anatomically-accurate model of the whole structure would behave in
terms of propagation of spontaneous and electrically-induced neuronal
activity.

Importantly, we did not consider learning through synaptic plasticity,
even though such mech- anisms could drastically modify synaptic
conduction for the whole network (Borges et al., 2017). Even more
interestingly, the inclusion of spike-timing-dependent plasticity would
enable the inves-

tigation of stimulation protocols aimed at promoting LTP, such as
theta-burst stimulation (Larson and Munkácsy, 2015). This aspect would
be of uttermost importance to make a link with memory encoding and
retrieval processes (Axmacher et al., 2006; Tsanov and Manahan-Vaughan,
2009; Ju- tras et al., 2013) and with neurostimulation studies for
memory improvement (Titiz et al., 2017; Solomon et al., 2021).

From the point of view of neurostimulation, future work is needed to
extend the current model to a multi-compartment representation of
neurites, since axons are known to be preferentially ac- tivated by
extracellular electrical stimulation (Rattay et al., 2003). Speciﬁcally,
multi-compartment cable models have been developed to investigate spike
initiation and propagation by modeling the axon as a series of
resistance-capacitance circuits following its trajectory (Rattay et al.,
2003; Joucla and Yvert, 2012; Ashida and Nogueira, 2018). These models
are particularly suited to study the effects of extracellular
stimulation, which are non-intuitive and depend as a ﬁrst approxima-
tion on the second spatial derivative of the electrical potential along
the cell membrane (Rattay, 1986; Rattay et al., 2003; McIntyre et al.,
2004; Rattay et al., 2018). Here, we have modeled electri- cal
stimulation as an intracellular current applied equally across all
neurons in the targeted area, which is extremely simpliﬁed but enables
computational tractability. Future developments will fo- cus on
developing an equivalent multicompartment model with realistic axonal
trajectories while making suﬃcient simpliﬁcations to allow for realistic
computation times.

Finally, we likened conditions of low theta input to pathological states
characteristic of oscil- lopathies such as Alzheimer’s disease, as these
conditions disrupted all aspects of theta-gamma oscillations in our
model: theta power, gamma power, and theta-gamma PAC Figure 5. However,
it should be noted that changes in theta or gamma power in these
pathologies are often unclear, and that the most consistent alteration
that has been reported in Alzheimer’s disease is a reduction of
theta-gamma PAC (for review, see Kitchigina (2018)). Future work should
explore the effects of cellular alterations intrinsic to the hippocampal
formation and their impact on theta-gamma oscil- lations.

Outlook Overall, this new model of the hippocampal formation represents
a methodologically innovative basis to further explore multiple
neurostimulation strategies that target hippocampal oscillations.
Moreover, the limitations discussed above represent important avenues
for future reﬁnements, which will require signiﬁcant work to overcome
the costs in terms of computational tractability (e.g., modeling the
whole hippocampus, or using multicompartment models of axonal
trajectories and dendritic trees). Ultimately, such model reﬁnements
should allow the investigation of the effects of extracellular
stimulation using charge-balanced biphasic pulses and multipolar
electrode con- ﬁgurations with realistic electrode geometries. Most
importantly, we believe that our current work may also serve as an
inspiration for future computational models of oscillopathies (not
necessarily limited to the hippocampus), which could beneﬁt from
interfacing abstract sets of synchronizing oscillators and investigating
their interactions with biophysically-realistic neurons.

Materials and Methods

Computational Model Overall Architecture We aimed to develop a
computational model of the hippocampal formation that is able to
generate theta-nested gamma oscillations and takes into account the
dynamic nature of the theta input from the medial septum, i.e., the
reset of the theta phase following strong activity in the perforant path
or fornix (Buño et al., 1978; Williams and Givens, 2003). To this end,
we adapted a previous biophysical model of the human hippocampal
formation under ﬁxed sinusoidal input (Aussel et al., 2018) and
interconnected it with an abstract representation of the medial septum,
modeled as an assembly of Kuramoto oscillators (Kuramoto, 1984) (Figure
1).

More precisely, we modeled a 15-mm thick coronal slice of the
hippocampal formation which comprises the DG, the CA3 and CA1 subﬁelds
of the hippocampus, and the EC, all populated with excitatory and
inhibitory Hodgkin-Huxley neurons. For the medial septum, we opted for a
sim- pliﬁed representation where the medial septum projects only to the
EC, which in turn drives the different subﬁelds of the hippocampus (see
also L142-151). In our model, Kuramoto oscillators are therefore
connected to the EC neurons and they receive projections from CA1
neurons (see sections below for more details).

Medial septum: Kuramoto Oscillators The medial septum contains pacemaker
neurons (Varga et al., 2008; Hangya et al., 2009) that syn- chronize
with one another and generate a global theta rhythm. In turn, these
pacemaker neurons drive downstream areas that receive projections from
the medial septum. Here, we modeled the entire medial septum neuronal
assembly as a set of coupled phase oscillators following the Ku- ramoto
model (Kuramoto, 1984), which generated the driving theta rhythm that
was provided to the hippocampal formation through the EC (Breakspear et
al., 2010).

Kuramoto oscillators have also been used to investigate the effects of
neurostimulation on synchronized brain rhythms in the context of
Parkinson’s disease or essential tremor (Tass, 2003; , which Weerasinghe
et al., 2019). Here, each Kuramoto oscillator was described by its phase
𝜃𝑖 evolves over time according to the following equation:

𝑑𝜃𝑖 𝑑𝑡

(1) 

denotes the natural frequency of oscillator 𝑖, and is normally
distributed around the The term 𝜔𝑖 center frequency 𝑓0 and with standard
deviation 𝜎. The synchronization parameter 𝑘 represents the coupling
strength of the group of oscillators, and 𝑁 is the number of
oscillators. Higher values for the synchronization parameter indicate
stronger coupling between pairs of oscillators, thus af- fecting how
fast or slow their phases tend to synchronize. The ﬁnal product
𝐺𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑋(𝑡)𝑍(𝜃𝑖) is used to describe the effects of external inputs on
the phase of the oscillators. Here, the only external input originates
in the projections from CA1 to the medial septum. It is described by the
instanta- neous ﬁring rate 𝑋(𝑡) of the CA1 excitatory population. 𝐺𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑡
is an arbitrary gain that determines the strength of the CA1 input to
the oscillators. Finally, the function 𝑍(𝜃𝑖) describes how the effects
of CA1 inputs on the oscillators depend on the phase of the ongoing
theta rhythm.

The coherence and phase of the driving theta rhythm 𝐼𝜃

were computed using the order pa- rameter 𝑟 to extract the mean
amplitude 𝐴 and the mean phase 𝜙 of the ensemble of Kuramoto oscillators
as follows:

𝜙(𝑡) = Im(𝑟) 𝐼𝜃(𝑡) = 𝐺𝜃 𝐴(𝑡) cos(𝜙(𝑡))+1 where the mean amplitude 𝐴(𝑡)
and the mean phase 𝜙(𝑡) are derived by taking the real and imagi- nary
part of the order parameter respectively, and the output theta rhythm
𝐼𝜃(𝑡) is a rectiﬁed cosine, that controls the maximum output amplitude
(in nA). multiplied by a gain 𝐺𝜃 To simulate the effect of the
projections from CA1 to the medial septum on the phase of the
oscillators, an approximation of the instantaneous ﬁring rate of the CA1
excitatory population was used as the term 𝑋(𝑡). To obtain the
instantaneous ﬁring rate, we convolved the CA1 population spike train
with an exponential kernel using the following equations:

spike timings, and 𝜏𝐹 𝑅 of the kernel, which was set to 10 ms to compute
population activity (for single neurons, a typical value is 100 ms)
(Gerstner et al., 2014).

Hereafter, we call the term 𝑍(𝜃) the phase response function, to
distinguish it from the PRC ob- tained from experimental data or
simulations (see section below “Data Analysis”, “Phase Response Curve”).
Brieﬂy, the PRC of an oscillatory system indicates the phase delay or
advancement that fol- lows a single pulse, as a function of the phase at
which this input is delivered. The phase response function 𝑍(𝜃) was
chosen to mimic as well as possible experimental PRCs reported in the
literature (Lengyel et al., 2005; Kwag and Paulsen, 2009; Akam et al.,
2012). These PRCs appear biphasic and show a phase advancement
(respectively delay) for stimuli delivered in the ascending
(respectively descending) slope of theta. To accurately model this
behavior, we used the following equation for the phase response
function, where 𝜃𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 represents the phase at which the theta rhythm
reaches its maximum and the parameter 𝜙𝑜𝑓 𝑓 𝑠𝑒𝑡

controls the desired phase offset from the peak:

𝑍(𝜃𝑖) = − sin(𝜃𝑖 − (𝜃𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 + 𝜙𝑜𝑓 𝑓 𝑠𝑒𝑡))

the bidirectional connec- tions between medial septum-hippocampal
formation can be found in Table 1.

Hippocampal formation: Hodgkin-Huxley Neurons The following sections
describe in detail how individual neurons and synapses were modeled, and
are adapted from the original work by Aussel and colleagues (Aussel et
al., 2018). Neurons were modeled as conductance-based single
compartments, following the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism (Hodgkin and
Huxley, 1952), in line with previous work (Aussel et al., 2022, 2018).

Noise (𝜂), accounting for random inputs to the network, was simulated as
intracellular current acting on the membrane voltage and following the
properties of a Gaussian random variable with a mean of 0 𝜇𝑉 and a
standard deviation of 1000 𝜇𝑉 (𝜂𝐸 ∼ 𝑁(0, 1000) 𝜇𝑉 ) for excitatory
neurons and a mean of 0 𝜇𝑉 and standard deviation of 100 𝜇𝑉 (𝜂𝐼 ∼ 𝑁(0,
100) 𝜇𝑉 ) for inhibitory neurons. The ratio of 1:10 between the noise
terms was adapted from the original work and it accounts for the higher
excitability of the inhibitory neurons as well as the E-I population
size ratios.

The original model introduced some parameters representing the vigilance
state (i.e., active wakefulness vs slow-wave sleep). However, the
present model only focused on the state of active wakefulness, since
this is when memory-related theta-nested gamma oscillations occur. For
all simulations, the parameters were set so that the network operated in
the wakefulness regime in a healthy hippocampus (Aussel et al., 2018).
The full expressions for all the parameters deﬁned above can be found in
Table 2 for pyramidal cells and in Table 3 for interneurons.

A two-dimensional simpliﬁed image depicting a coronal slice of the
hippocampal formation (Aussel et al., 2018) was used as a basis for a
two-dimensional manifold that was uniformly pop- ulated by neurons
following a density-driven approach (Rougier, 2018). Pyramidal neurons
were uniformly distributed within the stratum pyramidale (or within the
stratum granulosum for the den- tate gyrus) and interneurons were
uniformly distributed within the stratum oriens. Initial neuron
positions were drawn from a blue noise distribution and a Voronoi
diagram was computed. To ad- just the positions of the neurons over a
centroidal Voronoi diagram, the Lloyd relaxation algorithm was applied
for 1000 iterations. Transitioning from a two-dimensional manifold to a
3D reconstruc- tion of the hippocampal formation was achieved through
the addition of the third coordinate with values uniformly distributed
between 0 and 15 mm.

Hippocampal formation: inputs and connectivity The hippocampal formation
receives most of its external inputs from the EC. Activity from the EC
is projected to all hippocampal subﬁelds, starting with the DG. DG
granule cells project onto the CA3 pyramidal cells via mossy cell ﬁbers.
CA3 projects in turn to CA1 via Schaffer collaterals. These connections
form the tri-synaptic pathway. Direct connections from the EC towards
the CA3 and CA1 subﬁelds through the monosynaptic pathway are also
considered. Pyramidal neurons from CA1 project to pyramidal neurons and
interneurons in the EC, closing the hippocampal-entorhinal loop. CA1
pyramidal neurons also project to the medial septum through the fornix.
An overview of the connections between areas is presented in panel B of
Figure 1.

In the current model, EC pyramidal neurons and interneurons receive
oscillatory theta input from the medial septum in the form of an
excitatory intracellular current as described in Equa- tion 2 and
Equation 5. Projections from CA1 towards the medial septum were modeled
as a signal representing the collective ﬁring rate of the CA1 pyramidal
neurons. All connections towards and from the medial septum are
summarized in panels A and B of Figure 1.

Synaptic connectivity between neurons within a region is characterized
using a probability 𝑝 and is distance-based, following a Gaussian-like
distribution (Equation 14) with a width 𝜎 of 2500𝜇𝑚 deﬁnes the maximum
(excitatory synapses) and 350𝜇𝑚 (inhibitory synapses). The value of

rhythm 𝑓𝑜𝑠𝑐,𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔 each excitatory population 𝑓𝑒𝑥𝑐,𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔 also at 6 Hz
(meaning that each excitatory cell should spike on average once per
theta cycle). Because of the ratio between excitatory and inhibitory
neurons in the model, this resulted in ﬁring rates of about 60 Hz in
inhibitory neurons. These targeted val- ues were inspired by literature
in behaving rodents showing that hippocampal pyramidal neurons typically
ﬁre at rates below 10 Hz, usually between 1 and 2 Hz, and that
interneurons ﬁre at rates between 20 and 80 Hz (Hirase et al., 2001). In
practice, the obtained ﬁring rates were constrained by the
simpliﬁcations made in the model. The mean population ﬁring rate 𝑓𝑒𝑥𝑐

was computed by counting the number of spikes in the last second of a
3-s simulation run, to avoid edge effects due to the non-physiological
initial con- ditions, and by averaging this number over time and across
neurons. The oscillatory frequency was computed as the mean of the
inverse of the timing between all pairs of consecutive peaks 𝑓𝑜𝑠𝑐 in the
theta rhythm. Finally, the metric used to adjust parameters (input
strength and connection strengths) was calculated as the Euclidean
distance between the targeted and obtained ﬁring rate and oscillatory

in which all the connection strengths were set to 0. The tuning
procedure was performed in the absence of noise.

1.  First, we adjusted the amplitude of the theta input to a value that
    would produce a mean ﬁring rate of 6 Hz in the excitatory population
    of the EC. To this end, the input strength was progressively
    increased from 0 to 0.5 nA in steps of 0.01 nA, and the value that
    maximized our metric was selected.

2.  We then adjusted similarly the connection strength from the EC to
    the DG, increasing it from

0 to 20 in steps of 0.1.

3.  We repeated the procedure to jointly tune the connection strengths
    from EC and DG to CA3, assuming an equal contribution from these two
    areas. These two connection strengths were set to the same value and
    were increased from 0 to 5 in steps of 0.1.

4.  We followed the same procedure to jointly tune the connection
    strengths from CA3 and EC

to CA1, assuming again an equal contribution from these two areas.

5.  The last connection from CA1 to EC was more diﬃcult to tune because
    it closes the feedback loop and induces complex dynamics when too
    strong. To tune it, we temporarily uncoupled CA1 from all other
    structures and temporarily added a ﬁxed sinusoidal input at the
    target frequency of 6 Hz to both excitatory and inhibitory CA1
    neurons. We ﬁrst adjusted this input amplitude to generate a mean
    ﬁring rate of about 6 Hz in CA1 excitatory neurons. Next, the
    connection strength from CA1 to EC was adjusted to also achieve a
    mean ﬁring rate of 6 Hz in EC excitatory neurons.

6.  Because EC receives both an external input and feedback from CA1, we
    assumed that both these contributions should be decreased for the
    system to behave in a physiological range in the presence of the
    feedback loop. We, therefore, decided to divide by two the
    connection strength from CA1 to EC obtained in step 5. All other
    connection strengths were then set again to the values tuned in the
    previous steps, and the temporary external input to CA1 was removed.
    The external theta input to the EC was reinstated and tuned again as
    in step 1.

Following the above procedure, the inter-area synaptic connectivity
parameters were set for all subsequent simulations. The values are
summarized in Table 8. Empty cells denote no effective connectivity.

Numerical Implementation The model was implemented with the Brian2
libraries for Python (Stimberg et al., 2019) (see Data availability
section for access to the code). Simulations were performed using a
timestep of 0.1 ms and a total simulation duration ranging between 3-10
seconds (depending on the experiment, see results section). The average
time for simulating 1 second for the complete model locally was 10
minutes.

Neural mass model interfaced with Kuramoto oscillators The neural masses
represented in Figure S8 were modeled using the Wilson-Cowan formalism,
with parameters adapted from Onslow et al. (2014). Speciﬁcally, the
ﬁring rates of the excitatory and inhibitory populations were determined
by the following equations:

with parameters 𝛽 and 𝑥𝑚 set to 4 and 1 respectively, according to the

Equation 1. For these simulations we used a set of 𝑁 = 100 oscillators

parameters were kept as previously shown in Table 1. The neural reset

We increased the phase reset gain signiﬁcantly compared to the
Hodgkin-Huxley model, as the Onslow model utilized a sigmoid function
with values between 0 and 1, whereas the instantaneous ﬁring rate of the
populations of single-compartment neurons was much higher and therefore
had a stronger phase resetting effect.

Data Analysis During each simulation, we monitored and exported the
following data for subsequent analysis: (i) spike timings per neuron,
(ii) time series of ionic currents, (iii) septal input theta rhythm and
phase, and (iv) time series of electrical stimulation. Theta phase was
wrapped between [−𝜋, 𝜋] with a phase of 0 radians corresponding to the
peak of theta rhythm. All PAC analyses were performed using the
TensorPAC toolbox for Python (Combrisson et al., 2020).

Firing rates To obtain instantaneous ﬁring rates, the corresponding
spike trains were binned in 5-ms rectan- gular windows with a 90%
overlap (i.e., consecutive windows were spaced by 0.5 ms). The number of
spikes within each bin was normalized by the bin size and the number of
neurons in the group, yielding instantaneous population ﬁring rates.
Where reported (i.e., values 𝜇𝐼 in Figure 3A), the mean population ﬁring
rates within a given time window (typically lasting several seconds)
were computed by binning all spikes in that time window and normalizing
by the window width and the number of neurons in the population.

and 𝜇𝐸

Spectral analyses Power spectral density (PSD) estimates were calculated
based on Welch’s method. The periodo- gram was computed using 1-s
windows with a 90% overlap, yielding a frequency resolution of 1 Hz. The
average spectral power within a speciﬁc frequency band was calculated
using Simpson’s rule within the desired frequency band [𝑓𝑙, 𝑓ℎ].
Spectrograms were computed using the short-time Fourier transform with a
sliding Hann window of 100-ms width and 99% overlap, yielding a fre-
quency resolution of 10 Hz.

Modulation Index The MI (Tort et al., 2008) was used to estimate the
degree of PAC between theta and gamma oscil- lations in the model. To
compute the MI, the normalized ﬁring rate traces were band-pass ﬁltered
in the frequency ranges of interest: 3-9 Hz for theta (referred to as
the “phase signal”) and 40-80 Hz for gamma (referred to as the
“amplitude signal”). Then, the phase and amplitude time series were
extracted from the ﬁltered signals using the Hilbert transform. A
histogram of the mean am- plitude of gamma over the phase of theta was
then extracted, using phase bins of 5 degrees. The MI

was ﬁnally calculated as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the
mean amplitude distribution and the uniform distribution. A higher MI
indicates stronger PAC. For a schematic representation regarding the
computation of the MI, refer to Figure 1 in Tort et al. (2010). These
computations were performed using the provided PreferredPhase and Pac
methods from the TensorPAC library for Python (Combrisson et al., 2020).

Comodulograms Comodulograms represent the amount of PAC between two
ranges of frequencies, used to ex- tract respectively a phase and an
amplitude signal. Speciﬁcally, we computed the MI between 80%
overlapping 1-Hz frequency bands used to compute the phase of the signal
(in the theta range), and 90% overlapping 10-Hz frequency bands used to
compute the amplitude of the signal (in the gamma range). The resulting
distribution of MI values was subsequently plotted as heat maps. An
inherent problem with the computation of the MI using simulated data was
the lack of frequency components in some frequency bands. Filtering the
data within 1-Hz frequency bands thus created a ﬂat signal, resulting in
high values of the MI despite the absence of modulation. To overcome
this limitation, we added uniform noise to the ﬁring rate signals prior
to computing the MI, with an amplitude of approximately 20% of the
maximum instantaneous ﬁring rates. The results with and without added
noise are presented in Figure S6.

Phase dependency of PAC For a given theta frequency, PAC depends on the
phase of the underlying theta oscillation. To identify this relationship
and the theta phase that maximizes coupling, we used the PreferredPhase
function of the TensorPAC toolbox. More precisely, we applied a Hilbert
transform to extract the phase of the theta signal (ﬁring rate band-pass
ﬁltered between 3 and 9 Hz) and the amplitude of the gamma signal
band-pass ﬁltered within narrow (10-Hz wide) frequency ranges between 20
and 100 Hz with a 90% overlap. For each narrow gamma range, we binned
the amplitude with respect to the phase in a similar way as in the
calculation of the MI. We obtained a vector of the binned high-frequency
amplitudes with respect to the phase of the low-frequency phase,
represented as a polar plot as in Figure 3C.

Phase Response Curves The PRC of an oscillatory system indicates the
phase delay or advancement that follows a single pulse, as a function of
the phase at which this input is delivered. To characterize the PRC of
our computational model, we applied a single stimulation pulse to CA1
across different phases of the theta rhythm and calculated the resulting
change in the theta phase. We split a single theta cycle into intervals
of width 𝜋∕8 radians and applied a single stimulation pulse of a given
amplitude. For each case, we ran two simulations: one with a stimulation
pulse and one without. Finally, we compared the theta phase 2.5 ms
post-stimulation and at the same time but in the absence of stimulation.
The resulting values for the phase difference Δ𝜙 were plotted against
the stimulation phase and are presented in Figure 3D for varying
stimulation amplitudes.

and medial septum oscillatory drive. A. Anatomical representation of the
neuronal types and interconnections within and between the medial septum
and the hippocampal formation (EC: entorhinal cortex, DG: dentate gyrus,
CA3 and CA1 ﬁelds of the hippocampus) B. Simpliﬁed anatomy of the
hippocampal formation, modeled as a 15-mm thick cylindrical slice, with
spatially segregated excitatory and inhibitory neurons (blue: excitatory
neurons, consisting of granule cells in DG and pyramidal cells in other
areas; red: inhibitory basket cells). C. Model architecture and
connectivity. Each area is comprised of one excitatory and one
inhibitory neuronal population. Theta drive is provided through input
from the medial septum, which is modeled as a set of 250 Kuramoto
oscillators and receives feedback connections from CA1. Electrical
stimulation Is modeled as an intracellular current affecting both
excitatory and inhibitory populations in the targeted area (shown here
for CA1). D. Illustration of Kuramoto oscillators with two different
levels of synchronization. Each dot represents one oscillator, its
position on the circle indicates its phase and its color its angular

coupled excitatory-inhibitory populations under ramping input to both
populations. A. Two coupled populations of excitatory pyramidal neurons
(𝑁𝐸 = 100) are driven by a ramping current input (0 nA to 1 nA) for 5 s.
As the input becomes stronger, oscillations start to emerge (shaded
green area), driven by the interactions between excitatory and
inhibitory populations. The green inset shows the raster plot (neuronal
spikes across time) of the two populations during the green shaded
period (red for inhibitory; blue for excitatory). When the input becomes
suﬃciently strong (shaded magenta area), the populations become highly
synchronized and produce oscillations in the gamma range (at
approximately 50 Hz). The spectrogram (bottom panel) shows the power of
the instantaneous ﬁring rate of the pyramidal population as a function
of time and frequency. It reveals the presence of gamma oscillations
that emerge around 2s and increase in frequency until 4 s, when they
settle at approximately 60 Hz. B. Similar depiction as in panel A. with
the pyramidal-interneuronal populations decoupled. The absence of
coupling leads to the abolition of gamma oscillations, each cell spiking

network behavior, spontaneously producing theta-nested gamma
oscillations and characterized by a reset of the theta phase following a
single stimulation pulse (vertical grey line, applied here in CA1 at a
theta phase of 𝜋∕2, i.e., in the middle of the descending slope). Top to

with 99% overlap), spectrograms for each CA1 population (windowed
short-time fast Fourier transform using a Hann sliding window: 100 ms
with 99% overlap). Spectrograms show gamma oscillations (around 60 Hz)
modulated by the underlying theta rhythm (∼ 4 Hz|), indicating
theta-gamma PAC. Theta phase reset after stimulation is associated with
a rebound of spiking activity and theta-nested gamma oscillations. B.
Power spectral densities of the CA1 ﬁring rates. Theta peaks are found
at 4 Hz for excitatory and inhibitory cells. Gamma activity is located
between 40 and 80 Hz. C. PAC as a function of theta phase and gamma
frequency. The polar plot represents the amplitude of gamma oscillations
(averaged across all theta cycles, see methods) at each phase of theta
(theta range: 3-9 Hz, phase indicated as angular coordinate) and for
different gamma frequencies (radial coordinate, binned in 10-Hz ranges),
indicating that gamma oscillations between 40 and 80 Hz occur
preferentially around the peak of theta. The MI gives an overall
quantiﬁcation of how the phase of low-frequency oscillations (3-9 Hz)
modulates the amplitude of higher-frequency oscillations (40-80 Hz) (see
Methods and Figure supplement 2). D. PRC in response to a single
stimulation pulse applied in CA1 at various phases of the ongoing theta
rhythm and for various stimulation amplitudes (color-coded). The phase
difference (left y-axis) shows the theta phase induced by the
stimulation pulse (computed 2.5 ms after the pulse), compared to the
phase computed at the same time in a scenario without stimulation.
Positive and negative phase differences respectively indicate phase
advances and delays. The grey trace shows the normalized amplitude of
theta (right 𝑦 axis) for different phases, used to indicate the peak and
trough of the rhythm. Stimulation applied in the ascending slope of
theta ([−𝜋, 0]) produced a phase advance and accelerated the rhythm
towards its peak (0 radians). Conversely, stimulation during the
descending slope ([0, 𝜋]) produced a phase delay that slowed down the
rhythm. Higher stimulation amplitudes yielded a stronger effect.

Pulsed stimulation was delivered continuously with a frequency ranging

ﬁrst the power spectral density of the population ﬁring rates using

frequencies. A. Pulsed stimulation of excitatory cells shows a higher
relative power in the stimulated neurons at low frequencies (20 and 40
Hz). B. Pulsed stimulation of inhibitory cells reveals neuronal
entrainment, i.e., a peak in their relative power, in the high gamma
range (80-100 Hz). C. Simultaneous pulsed stimulation of both
populations reveals a strong entrainment of inhibitory cells in the high
gamma range, and a more modest entrainment of excitatory cells at low
frequencies.

Quantiﬁcation of PAC with and without noise. A. Quantifying PAC in the
absence of noise produced inaccurate identiﬁcation of the coupled
frequency bands, due to the complete absence of oscillations at some
frequencies. All analyses are based on the CA1 ﬁring rates (top traces)
during a representative simulation. Power spectral densities of these
ﬁring rates (left) indicate that some frequencies have a power of 0. PAC
of the excitatory population was assessed using two graphical
representations, the polar plot (middle) and comodulogram (right), and
quantiﬁed using the MI. The comodulogram was calculated by computing the
MI across 80% overlapping 1-Hz frequency bands in the theta range and
across 90% overlapping 10-Hz frequency bands in the gamma range and
subsequently plotted as a heat map. In the absence of noise, a slow
theta frequency centered around 5 Hz is found to modulate a broad range
of gamma frequencies between 40 and 100 Hz. The value indicated on the
comodulogram indicates the average MI in the 3-9 Hz theta range and
40-80 Hz gamma range. As in Figure 3, the polar plot represents the
amplitude of gamma oscillations (averaged across all theta cycles) at
each phase of theta (theta range: 3-9 Hz, phase indicated as angular
coordinate) and for different gamma frequencies (radial coordinate,
binned in 1-Hz ranges). B. Adding uniform noise to the ﬁring rate (with
an amplitude ranging between 15 and 25% of the maximum ﬁring rate)
improved the identiﬁcation of the coupled frequency bands. In this case,
the slower theta frequency centered around 5 Hz modulates a gamma band
located between 45 and 75 Hz.

Figure S7. (Figure 3 – Figure Supplement 3) Network behavior generated
by Kuramoto oscillators with non-physiological phase response functions.
Each panel is similar to Figure 3A, but with a different offset added to
the phase response function of the Kuramoto oscillators (see methods,
Equation 4). The center frequency was set to 6 Hz in all of these
simulations. Overall, theta oscillations in these cases are less
sinusoidal and show more abrupt phase changes than in the physiological
case. A. A phase offset of −𝜋∕2 leads to an overall theta oscillation of
4 Hz, with a second peak following the main theta peak. B. A phase
offset of +𝜋∕2 reduces the peak of theta, resetting the rhythm to the
middle of the ascending phase. C. A phase offset of 𝜋 or −𝜋 leads to the
CA1 output resetting the theta rhythm to the trough of theta.
