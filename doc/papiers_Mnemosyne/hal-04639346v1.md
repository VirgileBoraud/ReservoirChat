Abstract

Artificial intelligence has accelerated innovations in different aspects of citizens' lives. Many contexts
have already addressed technology-enhanced learning, but educators at different educational levels now
need to develop AI literacy and the ability to integrate appropriate AI usage into their teaching. We take
into account this objective, along with the creative learning design, to create a formative intervention that
enables preservice teachers, in-service teachers, and EdTech specialists to effectively incorporate AI into
their teaching practices. We developed the formative intervention with Terra Numerica and Maison de
l'Intelligence Artificielle in two phases in order to enhance their understanding of AI and foster its
creative application in learning design. Participants reflect on AI's potential in teaching and learning by
exploring different activities
including its ethical
considerations and potential for innovative pedagogy. The approach emphasises not only acculturating
professionals to AI but also empowering them to collaboratively design AI-enhanced educational
activities that promote learner engagement and personalised learning experiences. Through this process,
participants in the workshops develop the skills and mindset necessary to effectively leverage AI while
maintaining a critical awareness of its implications in education.

Introduction

The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications has stirred widespread interest, particularly in
generative AI technologies (Chiu, 2024; Nguyen et al., 2024), not only from a professional perspective,
viewing it as the Fourth Education Revolution (Seldon et al., 2020) but also raising different types of
expectations from educators and learners related to the potential of AI to transform educational practices
through adaptability (Gligorea et al., 2023), creative pedagogies (Romero et al., 2023), and unethical
ways (Van Wyk, 2024).

Education should address the dual nature of AI technologies. While AI offers unprecedented opportunities
for transformative and civic engagement through enhanced collaboration, critical and computational
thinking, creativity, and problem solving (Järvela et al., 2023; Romero et al., 2023; Urmeneta & Romero,
2024), it also presents significant ethical and equity challenges. These challenges include the potential for
citizen passivity and alienation as AI applications mystify and automate activities that traditionally benefit
from human judgement and ethical considerations. Such a paradox underscores the importance of
acculturating educators and learners to AI, ensuring they possess both the literacy and ethical frameworks
needed to leverage AI positively while guarding against its less beneficial impacts. This balanced
approach is crucial to realising AI’s potential in education without compromising the human elements that
are essential to learning and development.

The study of AI's educational potential necessitates a comprehensive consideration within the context of
technology-enhanced learning (TEL) over recent decades. Historically, technology, from headphones to
personal computers and MOOCs, has carried promises of transformative educational advancements
(Escueta et al., 2017; Higgins et al., 2012; Zhai et al., 2021). However, a socio-critical lens must
scrutinise the optimism surrounding TEL, challenging techno-solutionist narratives that oversimplify
complex societal issues (Selwin, 2023). Technological advancements, while improving processes, have
prompted a nuanced understanding of technology's role in education, advocating for a balanced approach
to leveraging technology for educational advancement (Elfert, 2023; Collin & Brotcorne, 2019). The
adoption of AI represents a unique shift in educational stakeholder perspectives, positioning AI as a
catalyst for transformative change within education (Seldon et al., 2020), aligned with the Fourth
Industrial Revolution (4IR) (Zhai et al., 2021).

Learning design support for creative pedagogy supported by AI

In this study, we develop a critical reflection on the activities developed at Terra Numerica and Maison de
l’Intelligence Artificielle (MIA) and the working group Scol\_IA (Romero et al., 2023; Urmeneta &
Romero, 2024). The formative intervention aims to support educators in their acculturation of AI and the
creative integration of AI in their educational practices. We explore how AI supports educators in
developing creative pedagogical approaches through a half-day workshop hosted at MIA. The workshop
is designed to provide hands-on learning experiences and collaborative design opportunities for in-service
teachers and students of the MSc Smart EdTech programme at Université Côte d’Azur.

During the initial exploration phase of the workshop, participants engage in interactive activities that
showcase various applications of generative and non-generative AI technologies relevant to education.
These activities include demonstrations of AI-driven tools for content creation, adaptive learning systems,
and intelligent
tutoring systems (ITS). These activities include image generation, face and object
correction, and social robotics based on AI. Through these experiences, educators gain insights into AI's
potential and develop their AI literacy.

Following the exploration phase, participants transition into a team-based design exercise where they
apply their understanding of AI to develop innovative pedagogical activities using the #PPAI6 model
framework. This model encourages educators to leverage AI for creative purposes in education, such as
thinking, promoting personalised learning pathways, or facilitating collaborative
fostering critical
projects. By providing practical guidance and collaborative opportunities, this workshop bridges the gap
between AI technology and effective educational practice. The results of our research provide valuable
insights and resources to support the ongoing integration of AI in education, facilitating continuous
improvement and adaptation in pedagogical approaches.

Human-AI collaboration in education through a creative pedagogy perspective

With the increasing prevalence and accessibility of AI systems, the dynamics between humans and AI
have progressed from mere process automation to a collaborative partnership founded on mutual
synergies and strengths (Razmerita et al., 2022), as well as the metacognitive potential inherent in
human-AI collaboration (Romero et al., 2023). It is within this intersection of human intuition and
that the greatest
imagination, coupled with AI's computational power and processing capabilities,

potential for human-AI co-creativity emerges. This potential is already evident across various creative
domains, such as music composition and performance (Rohrmeier, 2022), as well as in the visual arts,
where artists have utilized AI tools to enrich their creative processes (Kim et al., 2021), leveraging an
extensive learning approach aimed at transformative objectives (Romero et al., 2023). However, for our
focus, it is the prospect of reimagining creativity through the prism of human-AI interactions, innovative
teaching strategies, and learner-centric activities that may enable us to nurture learners' agency and foster
a creative pedagogy supported by human-AI collaborations. To facilitate the identification of the different
levels of creative engagement in the use of AI, the Passive-Participatory (PP) model for AI in education
(#PPai6) distinguishes six levels of creative engagement (Figure 3).

Figure 3
Creative engagement in AI in education

At the first level, learners act as passive consumers, engaging with AI-generated content without a full
understanding of its workings. Moving through the levels, learners progress to become interactive
consumers, actively interacting with AI-generated content as the AI system adapts to their actions. Levels
three and four involve individual and collaborative content creation, respectively, with learners utilising
AI tools to generate new content. The fifth level, participatory knowledge co-creation, sees teams creating
content with the aid of AI tools and collaboration from stakeholders to tackle complex problems. At the
sixth and most advanced level, expansive learning supported by AI, participants' agency expands or
transforms problematic situations through formative interventions. AI tools play a crucial role in
identifying contradictions in complex problems, generating concepts or artefacts to regulate conflicting
stimuli, and fostering collective agency and action. While the potential for AI to reach this transformative
level is immense, it is noteworthy that the majority of current AI in education studies operate at the
second level (interactive consumer), primarily relying on Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). The
exploration of higher levels presents an exciting frontier for the future development and implementation
of AI in education that will be explored through the different case studies of this book.

To facilitate the design, we propose that pre-service teachers and edtech professionals develop their
co-design learning activity using a template. The template provides a structured approach for designing
learning activities that effectively integrate AI into education as a support for the learners activities or as a
way to develop their learners’ AI literacy (Alexandre et al., 2020). The formative intervention follows a
step-by-step process for defining the learning objectives, targeting specific learner groups, and outlining
the entire process from conception to evaluation.

● Step 1 invites users to choose and articulate a learning objective for their activity, probing the

rationale behind the selection to ensure alignment with broader educational goals.

● Step 2, termed "Learning Activity," details the breakdown of the activity into three stages:
Preparation, Development, and Debriefing. This sequential structuring is crucial for organizing
content and interaction phases efficiently.

● Step 3 addresses the resources necessary for the activity, emphasizing the importance of both

analogical and technological tools to foster a conducive learning environment.

● Step 4 encourages users to describe specific learning strategies that will be employed during the

activity, tailoring approaches to enhance engagement and effectiveness.

● Step 5 allows for the naming of the activity and the specification of learning modalities (online,
face-to-face, or hybrid), crucial for setting the context in which the activity will be executed.
Additionally, it prompts the designer to consider potential success factors and challenges during
the activity orchestration.

The use of the template has permitted a reduction of the time required to develop a first draft of an
AI-enhanced learning activities for their educational context, but also a better focus during the
coordination efforts of the co-design activity.

Discussion

Education is undergoing a profound transformation as we embrace the potential of AI to enhance creative
pedagogies, as evidenced by our recent workshop at Maison de l'Intelligence Artificielle (MIA). Our
workshop highlighted that education extends beyond the transmission of knowledge; it aims to cultivate
creative thinking, critical skills, and a lifelong love of learning. Human-AI collaborations that support and
augment learners and educators activities require the development of AI literacy and supporting the
complexity of learning design activities (Duret & Romero, 2022) through visualisation tools such as the
co-design template proposed for this formative intervention. This transformative approach presents an
opportunity to redefine creative pedagogies by integrating AI into educational practices across different
levels and domains, thus opening up new avenues for personalised, engaging, and transformative learning
experiences. By adopting an expansive learning approach (Engeström & Sannino, 2010; Romero,
Duguay, et al., 2023), we can develop educators’ agencies to identify and integrate AI's capabilities to
augment teaching and learning activities while supporting the development of AI literacy for everyone.
