 Problem Statement 

• Promoting a "world community of scientifically and technologically literate citizens" was a top priority for the global Conference on Education for All, held at Jomtien in 1990 (Layton, 

Jenkins, & Donnelly, 1994). 

• Developing fundamental science process skills, including observation, classification, communication, measurement, inference, and prediction (Turinam et al., 2012), is a key 
component of science education. These abilities span a variety of cognitive, psychomotor, and affective abilities that enable students to engage effectively in scientific inquiry and 
exploration (Bybee, 1997). 

• Modular Robotics are user-friendly artifacts that allow students to design, build, and program robots, providing an engaging and hands-on learning experience in science classrooms 

(Papert, 2020). 

• The creative problem-solving (CPS) experiences using modular cube robotics of students at different educational levels can be different as well. Elementary students often approach 
problems intuitively and may struggle with abstract reasoning (Syawaludin, Gunarhadi, & Rintayati, 2019). Middle school students, according to Lin and Chiu (2004), tend to apply more 
systematic problem-solving strategies. High school students, as reported by Choi, Jung, and Baek (2013), often demonstrate higher-order thinking skills and a more analytical approach to 
problem-solving. 

o Despite the potential advantages of Modular Robotics in science education, little is known about how its application affects students' experiences in developing fundamental science 

abilities at various educational levels. 

Research Objectives 

• Research Objective 1 (RO1). To investigate how students of different educational levels experience practicing basic science process skills while CPS through modular robotics. 
• RO2. To identify and compare the differences in the CPS experiences of elementary, middle school, and high school students when using Cube Robotics in science classrooms to practice 

basic science process skills. 

Creative Problem Solving (CPS) Procedures in CreaCube Tasks 
Through the robotic cubes that the subjects’ control in this ill-defined CPS task, mediated by tangible interactive technologies, we can observe the development of new 
ideas, their evaluation, their inhibition, and their transformation across the CPS process (Romero, 2022). The participants engage in two crucial processes, Divergent 
Thinking (DT) and Convergent Thinking (CT), demonstrating a specific creative intention and endurance in preserving it throughout the task (Leory & Romero, 
2021). The process of idea generation relies on divergent thinking, a fast, implicit system grounded in prior information and actions. In contrast, 
idea evaluation through convergent thinking demands more effort due to the 
learner's persistence and motivational orientation toward desired outcomes. 
Ultimately, the creative outcome, if predefined, guides implicit processing 
and encourages further creative behaviors through explicit processing, 
ultimately leading to the desired outcome (Romero, 2022). 

Six Basic Science Process Skills (The Science Process Skills | 
NARST, n.d.) 
The six basic science process skills are Observing, Inferring, Measuring, Communicating, 
Classifying, and Predicting (Turiman et al., 2012). A brief explanation of the process skills 
is as follows- 

Observing- Observing is the process of learning about an object or event by using 

one's senses. 

Inferring- Making an "educated guess" about a thing or an event based on 

previously obtained data or information is known as inferring. 

Measuring- Measuring describes an object's or event's dimensions using 

conventional and ad hoc measurements or estimates. 

Communicating- Using words or visual symbols to describe a process, a thing, or 

an event is known as communicating. 

Classifying- Classifying is the process of gathering or arranging things into 

categories based on characteristics or standards. 

Predicting- Speculating on a future event's result based on a pattern of evidence 

is known as a prediction.
