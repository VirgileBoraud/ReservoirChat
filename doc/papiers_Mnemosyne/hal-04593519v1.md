Abstract
This research paper emphasizes the significance of nurturing critical thinking and agency among
citizens to drive the transformation of cultures of resource exploitation towards more regenerative
practices in education and business. Drawing on cultural historical activity theory, the paper argues
that promoting critical
thinking enables individuals to challenge existing norms and envision
sustainable alternatives, while agency empowers individuals to actively participate in shaping their
social and cultural environments. The paper underscores the need for educational and business
environments that foster critical thinking and agency and suggests strategies such as collaborative and
participatory learning, diverse perspectives in the curriculum, real-world problem-solving, and
sustainability education. By integrating cultural historical activity theory into educational and business
practices, it is posited that individuals can develop the skills and agency necessary to actively engage
in transforming cultures of (human) resource exploitation towards more regenerative practices,
benefiting not only the present generation but also future generations and the overall sustainability of
our planet.

Keywords: agency, critical thinking, creativity, cultural historical activity theory, talent management,

Introduction
In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the urgent need to move from cultures of
resource exploitation and unsustainable practices to more regenerative approaches. It must be
understood as a radical change requiring a fundamental change in how not only humans but also
society interact with and engage (human) resources, both in educational settings and in the business
world. In this research paper, we argue that agency stems from critical and politicized thinking among
citizens (Wallenhorst, 2022). Hence, agency is understood as a crucial force to obtain this profound
and radical change from the system that exhausts, more than ever, our natural resources. Our paper
will draw upon the lens of cultural historical activity theory (CHAT) to underscore that CHAT can
provide a theoretical framework around the idea of a collective responsibility for the transformation of
our lifestyle. . Cultures of exploitation of (human) resources refer to societal or organizational systems
that prioritize the extraction, utilization, and exploitation of resources without considering long-term
sustainability, ecological impact, or social consequences. These cultures may prioritize short-term
gains, profit-oriented approaches, and unsustainable practices that deplete resources, harm the
environment, and exploit human labor; sustainability and sustainable development may be understood
to include human capacity for agency aiming at both societal and ecological change (Agbedahin &
Lotz-Sisitka, 2019). On the other hand, regenerative cultures (Collado-Ruano & Segovia-Sarmiento,
2022) emphasize a shift towards sustainable, restorative, and holistic approaches that aim to restore

and revitalize ecosystems, communities, and human well-being. Regenerative culture is “healthy,
resilient, and adaptable, caring for the planet and all life in the awareness that this is the most effective
way to create a thriving future for all of humanity” (Contreras et al., 2019, p. 23). Regenerative
cultures prioritize a regenerative mindset that fosters resilience, equity, and sustainability, and seeks to
replenish, renew, and restore resources, both natural and human, for future generations. As such,
cultures of exploitation and regenerative cultures may be considered exemplars of transactional
intelligence (taking action in one’s own best interest) and transformational intelligence, whereby
individuals are pushed to act in the interest of the greatest number (Sternberg, 2021) so that “earth
does not become unfit for human life in society” (Wallenhorst, 2022, p. 269).

In this study, we start introducing five of the key 21st century skills based on the #5c21 framework,
including critical thinking, creativity, problem solving, collaboration, and computational thinking
(Romero, 2017). We discuss the OECD (2014) competency framework, considering interpersonal
skills such as building relationships, planning for the future (strategic skills), and achieving results
(delivery-related skills). Thereafter, we analyze how CHAT can provide insights into understanding
the role of critical thinking and agency in transforming cultures of resource exploitation, particularly
in educational and business contexts.

21st century skills for regenerative cultures
In the context of regenerative cultures, it is crucial to adopt a time perspective approach (Boyd, &
Zimbardo, 2012) that considers the past, present, and future when developing educational and
business activities. Building on the #5C21 competencies (Romero, 2017), which encompass critical
thinking, creativity, problem solving, collaboration, and computational thinking, we contend that
citizens also need to incorporate a forward-looking orientation that takes into account the long-term
consequences of their actions on the environment and society, which means being aware that we, as
humans, have become “a geological force" (Wallenhorst, 2022, p. 269). At the economic level,
Weidema (2018) and Nibourel (2011) propose to consider the social footprint for evaluating the social
impacts of a product or service throughout its entire life cycle, including its supply chain and
consumer use. The social footprint is important for a more regenerative culture because it provides a
framework for assessing the social
impacts of products and services in a systematic and
comprehensive way. By understanding the positive and negative social impacts of a product or service
throughout its life cycle, companies can identify areas for improvement and work towards more
socially sustainable practices. This can lead to a more regenerative culture where economic,
environmental, and social sustainability are all considered and balanced for long-term success.

Moreover, the OECD (2014) competency framework emphasizes interpersonal skills for building
relationships, strategic skills for planning for the future, and delivery-related skills for achieving
results. This includes considering the impact of present actions on future generations and the need to
plan and strategize for sustainable outcomes. Taking a time perspective approach allows individuals to
reflect on historical patterns of resource exploitation, assess the current state of resource utilization,
and plan for a more regenerative future by making informed decisions and taking responsible actions.
Incorporating this time perspective approach into educational and business practices can help
individuals develop a holistic understanding of regenerative cultures that consider the past, present,
and future, and promote sustainable practices for the benefit of current and future generations. Indeed,
the present generation always bears a responsibility towards future generations (Bertrand et al., 1997)

and this is why education contributes to the invention of a new vision for the planet and the way
humans interact with their environment, whether it is social or natural.

Figure 1 articulates the OECD (2014) skills in relation to the #5c21 competencies. The skills marked
as \* have been added to the original OECD framework to consider the skills considered in the
sustainable development goals (SGDs) and regenerative culture communities (Alm et al., 2022;
Collado-Ruano & Segovia-Sarmiento, 2022; Rieckmann, 2017).

Critical Thinking and Agency

thinking, as a cognitive process that

Critical
involves analyzing, evaluating, and synthesizing
information, plays a central role in agency. It enables individuals to critically examine the underlying
assumptions, values, and consequences of current practices and to develop alternative perspectives
and solutions. According to King and Kitchener (2004), postformal development in adults includes
three main phases (pre-reflective, quasi-reflective, reflective), and it is only in the last phase that

thinking has various components.

adults can become aware of all the aspects underlying the complexity of an environmental issue, for
example. The development of critical thinking is not thoughtless criticism of everything and anything,
but a reflective and reasonable evaluation of what to believe or do. Lipman (1988) characterizes it as
a responsible way of thinking that facilitates good judgment because it is criterion-referenced,
self-correcting, and context-sensitive. Critical
the
acquisition of knowledge, both about the issue under study and about the limits of knowledge, is
necessary. Subsequently, a person must become aware of the aspects, both affective and cognitive,
that guide his or her decision (criteria, values, beliefs, etc.). Several skills are involved in the
implementation of critical thinking: evaluation of information, reasoning, self-evaluation,
taking the
context into account, and developing criteria. In addition, critical thinking skills must be used across
the board and become habits of conduct, a way of being. Critical thinking should not only be used to
value our own points of view, but also to understand those of others. Through critical thinking,
individuals can challenge dominant discourses and power structures that perpetuate unsustainable
resource exploitation, and actively contribute to the construction of more regenerative cultures. This
awareness is the foundation of agency : it calls for action, a regenerative action.

Indeed,

CHAT emphasizes the importance of human agency, defined as individuals' ability to actively
participate and shape their social and cultural environments through their actions and intentions. It
breaks the cycle of the perception of humans that undergo the environment so they can empower
themselves and shape it. It is a mindset of emancipation where we understand the environment as a
human construct and, therefore, can deconstruct it to be regenerated to meet our needs and collective
aspirations. In the context of changing cultures of resource exploitation, agency is crucial for
individuals to engage critically with existing practices and norms, and to envision and enact more
sustainable and regenerative ways of interacting with resources. For Engreström and Sannino (2020),
agency “refers to the subject’s willed quest for transformation. It transpires in a problematic,
polymotivated situation in which the subject evaluates and interprets the circumstances, makes
decisions according to the interpretations, and acts upon these decisions. In sum, our concept of
transformative agency contains three necessary elements: (1) a situation of contradictory motives, (2)
the construction of an auxiliary stimulus-means i.e., the resources mobilized to address the problem
situation (e.g., material or psychological objects); and (3) practical action to transform the situation
with the help of the auxiliary stimulus-means. "The three elements typically come together in
successive steps, forming longitudinal mediational chains” (p. 90). In the field of business,
transformative agency can involve business leaders and stakeholders evaluating existing business
models that may prioritize short-term profits over long-term sustainability. Under the perspective of
transformative agency, business leaders can construct auxiliary stimulus-means, such as developing
circular economy strategies, promoting responsible supply chain management, and implementing
environmentally-friendly production practices. Leaders can then take practical actions, such as
investing in renewable energy, adopting sustainable packaging, and promoting fair labor practices, to
transform their business practices and foster a regenerative culture that values sustainability, social
responsibility, and ethical resource use. Under the perspective of transformative agency, educational
leaders can also take practical actions. For instance, they can implement digital citizenship models for
staff and students and teach the latter how to use digital tools as a powerful lever to solve creatively
complex problems inherited from past generations. They can install lunch composting stations in
partnership with municipalities, create outdoor classrooms as a means to raise awareness about
environmental education through curricula, and manage bee hives in urban settings to collect
sustainable honey. They can use artificial intelligence (AI) to predict students' threats to success

thanks to data analysis and correlation between students’ attendance, tasks at hand, and evaluation’s
up to date results.

In both educational and business contexts, the concept of transformative agency can empower
individuals to take purposeful actions towards regenerative practices, thereby contributing to the
development of cultures that prioritize sustainability, equity, and resilience.

in both school and out-of-school contexts,

Transformative agency can be applied to entrepreneurship education, as highlighted in the study by
Engeström and Käyhkö (2021). This can involve educators critically evaluating current
entrepreneurship education practices
identifying
contradictions or problematic motives, such as a narrow focus on profit-driven entrepreneurship
impact. With transformative agency, educators can
without considering sustainability or social
construct auxiliary stimulus-means, such as integrating sustainability-oriented and socially responsible
entrepreneurship concepts into the curriculum, promoting critical reflection on ethical considerations,
and fostering entrepreneurial mindsets that prioritize regenerative practices. They can then take
learning activities, engaging with local
practical actions, such as implementing experiential
community initiatives, and facilitating partnerships with sustainable enterprises,
to transform
entrepreneurship education practices and foster a regenerative culture that nurtures students' critical
thinking, agency, and responsible entrepreneurship towards more sustainable and socially responsible
resource use.

Promoting Critical Thinking and Agency in Education

Education plays a vital role in fostering critical thinking and agency among citizens, as it provides
opportunities for individuals to develop the cognitive and social skills necessary for engaging
critically with complex issues, including resource exploitation and the unacceptable risks (Jonas,
2013) of depleting Earth’s natural resources.

In 2006, Barma and Guilbert, suggested that goals in science education should be directed towards the
development of the social agency of future citizens, which we believe requires the development of
critical thinking in science. A more democratic society implies an increase in transparency and trust,
more public participation in the major societal debates. Thus, it seems particularly important to
develop a critical and democratic expertise for several reasons: to reduce the distance between the
experts and the population; to promote the development of social action; to encourage participation in
scientific-technical controversies; to make the population aware of the theoretical concepts and
research processes underlying the production of scientific knowledge; but also, and above all, to take
into account that citizens also have their own form of knowledge, expectations, needs, interests, and
an understanding of the constraints of their context that is different from that of scientists. Gone are
the days when education, in terms of the public understanding of science, was a simple vulgarization
of 'real' scientific knowledge, especially in this century, profoundly marked by AI and the immediate
portable access to information. Scientific methods imply the setting up of work teams,
the
mobilization of human and economic resources, and human and social capital, as well as the
management of all this - often in the midst of many conflicts. It seems that, more than ever, there’s a
blatant need for focusing on developing critical thinking and agency with our students, maybe
self-fulfilling Montaigne’s (1533-1592) epigraph: “Rather a well-made than a well-filled head”.
This epistemological posture leads us to a different educational context and takes us to the relevance
of CHAT which suggests that educators can create learning environments that facilitate critical
thinking. and agency by encouraging students to engage in collaborative and participatory learning

activities, such as group discussions, problem-solving tasks, and project-based learning, that foster
critical thinking and agency through social interaction and collective meaning-making (Engeström,
2001). They can also incorporate diverse perspectives and voices in the curriculum, including
indigenous knowledge and local cultural practices, to promote critical awareness of different ways of
interacting with resources and to challenge dominant discourses that perpetuate unsustainable
exploitation (Miettinen, 2000). Moreover, educators may provide opportunities for students to engage
in real-world problem-solving and action-oriented projects, such as community-based initiatives or
sustainable business ventures, that allow them to apply critical thinking skills in addressing real-world
resource exploitation challenges (Snyder & Snyder, 2008).

Promoting Critical Thinking and Agency in Business

Businesses, as key players in resource exploitation, also have a significant role to play in promoting
critical thinking and agency toward more regenerative cultures. CHAT suggests that businesses can
foster critical thinking and agency among their employees and stakeholders by encouraging a culture
of open inquiry and constructive dissent, where employees are encouraged to critically question
existing practices, challenge assumptions, and generate innovative solutions for more sustainable
resource exploitation (Nicolini, 2013). Employees can be engaged in cross-functional collaborations
and participatory decision-making processes that allow for diverse perspectives and expertise to be
considered, and that enable employees to actively contribute to shaping the organization's
sustainability practices (Choi & Ruona, 2011). Business can also benefit from sustainability education
and training programs in the workplace, which provide employees with the knowledge, skills, and
tools necessary for critically examining and addressing the social, economic, and environmental
impacts of resource exploitation (Kilbourne et al., 2013).

Discussion

From a CHAT perspective, promoting critical thinking and agency among citizens is essential for the
objective of changing cultures of resource exploitation towards more regenerative practices in
education and business and reaching sustainable global citizenship (Granados-Sánchez, 2023). By
fostering critical thinking, individuals are empowered to challenge existing norms, assumptions, and
practices related to resource exploitation and envision more sustainable alternatives. Through agency,
individuals can not only actively participate in shaping their social and cultural environments,
including educational settings and business organizations, towards more regenerative cultures, but
they are also trained to act upon their doubts, verify knowledge sources, and assess their very own
subjectivity. It is imperative for educators and businesses to create environments that foster critical
thinking and agency. In education, this can be achieved through collaborative and participatory
learning activities, incorporating diverse perspectives into the curriculum, and providing opportunities
for real-world problem-solving and action-oriented projects. In business, this can be accomplished by
promoting a culture of open inquiry and constructive dissent,
facilitating cross-functional
collaborations, and incorporating sustainability education and training programs that may participate
in changing the worldview and identity of learners (Mezirow, 1991) to promote transformative
learning (Michel et al., 2020). In this sense, transformative competences involve (1) creating new
value, (2) reconciling tensions and dilemmas, and (3) taking responsibility for one's actions (OECD,
2018). By integrating the insights from CHAT into educational and business practices, we can
contribute to the development of citizens who possess the critical thinking skills and agency necessary
to actively engage in transforming cultures of resource exploitation towards more regenerative

practices. This can ultimately lead to more sustainable and responsible approaches to resource
management, benefiting not only the present generation but also future generations and the planet as a
whole.
