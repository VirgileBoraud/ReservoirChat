Abstract

Understanding the behavior of the retino-thalamo-cortico-collicular (i.e. early) visual system in a natural
images situation is of utmost importance to understand what further happens in the brain. To understand
these behaviors, neuroscientists have looked at the standard Parvocellular and Magnocellular pathways
for decades. However, there is also the non-standard Koniocellular pathway, which plays an important
modulating role in the local, global, and intermingled processing carried out to achieve such behaviors.
Particularly, the standard motion analysis carried out by the Magno pathway is alternated with rapid
reactions, like ﬂeeing or approaching to speciﬁc motions, which are hard-wired in the Konio pathway. In
addition, studying a ﬁxation task in a real situation, e.g., when a predator slowly approaches its prey, not
only involves a motion mechanism, but also requires the use of the Parvo pathway, analyzing, at least,
the image contrast. Here, we study in a bio-inspired computational neural model how these pathways can
be modeled with a minimal set of parameters, in order to provide robust numerical results when doing
a real task. This model is based upon an important study to integrate biological elements about the
architecture of the circuits, the time constants and the operating characteristics of the diﬀerent neurons.
Our results show that our model, despite operating via local computations, globally shows a good network
behavior in terms of space and time, and allows to analyze and propose interpretations to the interplay
between thalamus and cortex. At a more macroscopic scale, the behaviors emerging from the model are
reproducible and can be qualitatively compared to human-made ﬁxation measurements. This is also true
when using natural images, where just a few parameters are slightly modiﬁed, keeping the qualitatively
human-like results. Robustness results show that the precise values of the parameters are not critical,
but their order of magnitude matters. Numerical instability occurs only after a 100% variation of a
parameter. We thus can conclude that such a reduced systemic approach is able to represent attentional
shifts using natural images, while also being algorithmically robust. This study gives us as well a possible
interpretation about the role of the Konio pathway, while at the same time allowing us to participate
in the debate between low and high-roads in the attentional and emotional streams. Nevertheless, other
information, such as color, is also present in the early visual system, and should be addressed together
with more complex cortical mechanisms in a sequel of this work.

R´esum´e

Comprendre le comportement du syst`eme visuel r´etino-thalamo-cortico-colliculaire (i.e. pr´ecoce) dans
une situation d’images naturelles est d’une importance capitale pour comprendre ce qui se passe ensuite
dans le cerveau. Pour comprendre ces comportements, les neurobiologistes ont ´etudi´e les voies standard,
Parvocellulaires et Magnocellulaires, depuis des d´ecennies. Cependant, il y a aussi la voie non-standard,
ou Koniocellulaire, qui joue un rˆole modulateur important dans les traitements local, global, et entremˆel´e,
pour atteindre de tels comportements. Particuli`erement, l’analyse standard du mouvement r´ealis´ee par
la voie Magno est altern´ee avec des r´eactions rapides, comme la fuite ou l’approche `a des mouvements
sp´eciﬁques, qui sont pr´e-cˆabl´es dans la voie Konio. De plus, l’´etude d’une tˆache de ﬁxation dans une
situation r´eelle, par exemple quand un pr´edateur s’approche lentement de sa proie, implique non seulement
un m´ecanisme de mouvement, mais n´ecessite ´egalement l’utilisation de la voie Parvo, qui analyse, au
moins, le contraste de l’image. Ici, nous ´etudions dans un mod`ele neuronal de calcul bio-inspir´e comment
ces voies peuvent ˆetre mod´elis´ees avec un ensemble minimal de param`etres, aﬁn de fournir des r´esultats
num´eriques robustes lors d’une tˆache r´eelle. Ce mod`ele repose sur une ´etude approfondie pour int´egrer
des ´el´ements biologiques dans l’architecture des circuits, les constantes de temps et les caract´eristiques
de fonctionnement des neurones. Nos r´esultats montrent que notre mod`ele, bien que fonctionnant via
des calculs locaux, montre globalement un bon comportement de r´eseau en termes d’espace et de temps,
et permet d’analyser et de proposer des interpr´etations de l’interaction entre le thalamus et le cortex.
`A une ´echelle plus macroscopique, les comportements du mod`ele sont reproductibles et peuvent ˆetre
qualitativement compar´es `a des mesures de ﬁxation oculaire chez l’homme. Cela est ´egalement vrai
lorsque l’on utilise des images naturelles, o`u quelques param`etres sont l´eg`erement modiﬁ´es, en gardant
des r´esultats qualitativement humains. Les r´esultats de robustesse montrent que les valeurs pr´ecises des
param`etres ne sont pas critiques, mais leur ordre de grandeur l’est. Une instabilit´e num´erique ne se
produit qu’apr`es une variation de 100% d’un param`etre. Nous pouvons donc conclure que cette approche
syst´emique est capable de repr´esenter les changements de l’attention en utilisant des images naturelles,
tout en ´etant algorithmiquement robuste. Cette ´etude nous donne ainsi une interpr´etation possible sur
le rˆole de la voie Konio, tandis qu’en mˆeme temps elle nous permet de participer au d´ebat sur les low
et high-roads des ﬂux attentionnel et ´emotionnel. N´eanmoins, d’autres informations, comme la couleur,
sont ´egalement pr´esentes dans le syst`eme visuel pr´ecoce, et pourraient ˆetre prises en consid´eration, ainsi
que des m´ecanismes corticaux plus complexes, dans les perspectives de ce travail.

Introduction

“The beginning is the most important part of the work”
– Plato

Understanding how the brain works is arguably one of the greatest scientiﬁc challenges
nowadays. There are two particularly massive initiatives trying to approach the challenge:
one is the Human Brain Project1, in Europe; and the other is the BRAIN Initiative, in
the US2. However, this huge challenge is also attacked by many research labs, beyond such
very mediatic consortium, as our team.

Among the processing carried out by the brain, more than a quarter of it is dedicated to
vision [174]. And despite decades of research, the mystery of vision [107] remains partially
unsolved. One possibility is that the diﬃculty to understand what happens in the brain
is a result of our lack of understanding of the earlier visual stages. This includes what
the brain receives, and how it is encoded, but also why (in terms of functionality) such
information has been developed along evolution.

The key point is that, through several studies, researchers have assumed that the retina
(in the eye) was practically a simple transducer, while the thalamus (between the eye and
the cortex) served as a simple relay of information towards the neocortex. Thus, under these
assumptions, almost every task should be accomplished by the cortex, from a processing
point of view. However, as scientists have explored these areas, they have found that
there is much, much more than previously thought. For example, sophisticated processing
such as detection of complex patterns (including motion and color) is already found in the
retina. In a coarse way, it provides enough information to guide actions [62]. This (e.g.
rapid detection of snakes in the pulvinar [176]), together with multi-modal synchronization

and regulation of information –among others–, has also been shown for the thalamus [149].
We also have the practical issue of technology: we cannot measure with a higher res-
olution than that provided by the state of the art equipment. We thus can observe in
vivo behavior of one neuron or a sub-population of neurons, in detail, thanks to electrode
arrays, or mesoscopic or macroscopic aspects of the brain activity at rather higher spatial
scale but low temporal precision (e.g., fMRI or optical imaging) or low spatial scale and
high temporal resolution (e.g., E.E.G. or M.E.G.). Fortunately, when looking at it from a
functional, global perspective, today we can already infer new things that can be tested at
more detailed levels, using numerical experiments. With methods related to those used by
engineers to design new airplanes, we are now able to simulate some aspects of the central
nervous system behavior, and derive some new ﬁndings from such experimentation.

This key point is our motivation to investigate further how the early visual system
works, how the neurons code information at the scale of neural maps and raise assumptions
about how the brain may process such information. We will carefully explain how minimal
models are to be worked out in such a paradigm. This does not negate the huge processing
power of the diﬀerent cortical areas. We simply support the trend of showing that certain
aspects of this processing are to be made explicit and studied. We also consider that the
visual system is really a distributed processing system as far as analyzing the information
captured from the visual world is concerned.

This work has been realized under the Franco-Chilean project KEOpS. The goal of
the project is to study and model the early visual system, focusing on the non-standard
behavior of retinal ganglion cells in natural scenarios. The retina is the ﬁrst stage in
the visual system, and understanding it better is expected to provide more knowledge
to understand the following stages of the visual system, and eventually the brain, since
they rely not only on “image input”, but also on the processing carried out in the visual
front-end to the diﬀerent information ﬂows.

This thesis also contributes to one application of KEOpS, i.e., to incorporate the re-
sulting models into real engineering applications as new dynamic early-visual modules able
to process natural image sequences.

Here, standard and non-standard retinal ﬂows are combined, from the retina to the
primary visual cortex, including thalamic and collicular structures. The idea is to close the
early visual system loop, with a special focus on attentional mechanism. This beautiful
mess is analyzed, modeled locally, but always having the systemic view in mind: complex
properties are not to be hardwired in the system, but shall instead emerge from the diﬀerent

xix

interactions between structures and connections.

Since we develop minimal models, but without loss of generality, the amount of pa-
rameters, and the mechanisms used to represent the real-world circuits, are simpliﬁed and
increased in complexity or amount only if really needed. This approach allows us to pro-
vide a relatively straightforward tool to analyze the early visual system, where the results
qualitatively reproduce human behavior while using sequences of natural images, and at
the same time provides robust, stable and easily modiﬁable modules for each structure
involved.

This is, in a nutshell, the work presented in detail in the following sections of this thesis.

Introduction

“Le d´ebut est la partie la plus importante du travail”
– Platon

Comprendre comment fonctionne le cerveau est sans doute l’un des plus grands d´eﬁs
scientiﬁques de nos jours.
Il y a deux initiatives particuli`erement massives qui tentent
d’aborder le d´eﬁ : l’un est le Human Brain Project3, en Europe; et l’autre est l’initiative
BRAIN, aux ´Etats-Unis4. Toutefois, ce d´eﬁ est aussi attaqu´e par de nombreux laboratoires
de recherche, au-del`a de ce consortium tr`es m´ediatique, comme notre ´equipe.

Parmi les traitements eﬀectu´es par le cerveau, plus d’un quart d’entre eux est d´edi´e `a la
vision [174]. Et malgr´e des d´ecennies de recherche, le myst`ere de la vision [107] ne reste que
partiellement r´esolu. Une possibilit´e est que la diﬃcult´e `a comprendre ce qui se passe dans
le cerveau soit le r´esultat de notre manque de compr´ehension des ´etapes visuelles pr´ecoces.
Cela comprend ce que le cerveau re¸coit, et comment cette information est cod´ee, mais aussi
pourquoi (en termes de fonctionnalit´e) de telles informations ont ´et´e d´evelopp´ees au cours
de l’´evolution.

Le point cl´e est que, `a travers plusieurs ´etudes, les chercheurs ont consid´er´e la r´etine
(dans l’oeil) pratiquement comme un transducteur simple, tandis que le thalamus (entre
l’oeil et le cortex) comme un simple relais de l’information vers le n´eocortex. Ainsi, sous
ces hypoth`eses, presque chaque tˆache doit ˆetre accomplie par le cortex, du point de vue du
traitement. Cependant, plus les scientiﬁques ont explor´e ces zones, plus ils ont trouv´e qu’il
y avait beaucoup, beaucoup plus qu’on ne le pensait. Par exemple, des traitements sophis-
tiqu´es tels que la d´etection de motifs complexes (y compris le mouvement et la couleur)
sont d´ej`a pr´esents dans la r´etine. D’une mani`ere grossi`ere, la r´etine fournit suﬃsamment

xxi

d’informations pour guider des actions [62]. Aussi, le thalamus a ´et´e montr´e capable
de r´eguler les ﬂux d’information que le traversent, ainsi que de synchroniser diﬀ´erentes
modalit´es (audition et vision, par exemple) [149]. Un autre example est pour le thalamus
et la d´etection rapide des serpents dans le pulvinar [176].

Nous avons aussi la question pratique de la technologie : nous ne pouvons pas mesurer
avec une r´esolution sup´erieure `a celle pr´evue par l’´equipement de pointe. Nous pouvons
ainsi observer le comportement in vivo d’un neurone ou d’une sous-population de neurones,
en d´etail, grˆace aux matrices d’´electrodes, ou des aspects m´esoscopiques ou macroscopiques
de l’activit´e c´er´ebrale `a des ´echelles spatiales plus ´elev´ees, mais avec une faible pr´ecision
temporelle (par exemple, avec les IRMf ou l’imagerie optique) ou une faible ´echelle spa-
tiale et une haute r´esolution temporelle (par exemple, avec EEG ou MEG). Heureuse-
ment, quand on regarde les choses d’un point de vue global, fonctionnel, aujourd’hui,
nous pouvons d´ej`a d´eduire de nouvelles choses qui peuvent ˆetre test´ees `a des niveaux plus
d´etaill´es, par des exp´eriences num´eriques. Avec des m´ethodes li´ees `a celles utilis´ees par
les ing´enieurs pour concevoir de nouveaux avions, nous sommes maintenant en mesure de
simuler certains aspects du comportement du syst`eme nerveux central, et de d´eriver, de
ces exp´erimentations, de nouvelles conclusions.

Ce point cl´e est notre motivation pour ´etudier plus loin comment fonctionne le syst`eme
visuel pr´ecoce, comment les neurones codent les informations `a l’´echelle des cartes neu-
rales, et pour proposer des hypoth`eses sur la fa¸con dont le cerveau peut traiter de telles
informations. Nous allons expliquer soigneusement comment les mod`eles minimaux doivent
ˆetre travaill´es dans un tel paradigme. Cela ne remet pas en cause l’´enorme puissance de
traitement des diﬀ´erentes aires corticales. Nous tentons simplement de montrer que cer-
tains aspects de ce traitement doivent ˆetre rendus explicites et ´etudi´es. Nous consid´erons
´egalement que le syst`eme visuel est vraiment un syst`eme de traitement distribu´e d`es que
l’analyse de l’information recueillie `a partir du monde visuel est concern´e.

Ce travail a ´et´e r´ealis´e dans le cadre du projet Franco-Chilien KEOpS. Le but du
projet est d’´etudier et de mod´eliser le syst`eme visuel pr´ecoce, mettant l’accent sur le
comportement non-standard des cellules ganglionnaires de la r´etine dans des sc´enarios
naturels. La r´etine est la premi`ere ´etape dans le syst`eme visuel, et mieux la comprendre
devrait fournir plus de connaissances pour comprendre les ´etapes suivantes du syst`eme
visuel, et, ´eventuellement, du cerveau, car ces ´etapes reposent non seulement sur l’image
d’entr´ee, mais ´egalement sur le traitement eﬀectu´e sur les diﬀ´erentes ﬂux d’information
dans les diﬀ´erentes structures.

xxii

Cette th`ese contribue ´egalement `a une application de KEOpS, c’est-`a-dire, `a int´egrer
les mod`eles qui en r´esultent dans de r´eelles applications d’ing´enierie en tant que de nou-
veaux modules dynamiques de vision pr´ecoce, capables de traiter des s´equences d’images
naturelles.

Ici, les ﬂux r´etiniens standard et non-standard sont combin´es, de la r´etine au cor-
tex visuel primaire, y compris des structures thalamiques et colliculaires. L’id´ee est de
fermer la boucle du syst`eme visuel pr´ecoce, avec un accent particulier sur le m´ecanisme
d’attention. Ce syst`eme est analys´ee et mod´elis´ee localement, mais en gardant toujours
la vue syst´emique `a l’esprit : les propri´et´es complexes ne doivent pas ˆetre cˆabl´ees dans le
syst`eme, mais doivent `a la place ´emerger des diﬀ´erentes interactions entre les structures et
les connexions.

Puisque nous d´eveloppons des mod`eles minimaux, mais sans perte de g´en´eralit´e, la
quantit´e de param`etres, et les m´ecanismes utilis´es pour repr´esenter les circuits du monde
r´eel, sont simpliﬁ´es et augment´es en complexit´e ou en montant seulement si c’est vraiment
n´ecessaire. Cette approche nous permet de fournir un outil relativement simple –peu de
param`etres et tr`es facile `a adapter– pour analyser le syst`eme visuel pr´ecoce, o`u les r´esultats
reproduisent qualitativement le comportement humain lors de l’utilisation de s´equences
d’images naturelles, et en mˆeme temps fournit des modules robustes, stables et facilement
modiﬁables pour chaque structure impliqu´ee.

C’est, en un mot, le travail pr´esent´e en d´etail dans les sections suivantes de cette th`ese.

Summary

New ﬁndings regarding the study of the retina and thalamus, due to increasingly more
interest to these structures, have led scientists to review their viewpoint in terms of the
functionality of these subcortical structures. One keypoint is that processing usually at-
tributed to the cortex has been in fact also made explicit -in a new but fast form- in these
early vision structures. The retina, on the one hand, providing the visual input for the
rest of the system, was considered mainly a transductor. However, some processing, such
as looming motion detection, has been found to be part of the mechanisms this two-layer
structure carries out as a visual front-end. The thalamus, on the other hand, was classically
regarded as a simple relay of feedforward information, but there is much more to add to the
story. For example, the thalamus receives neither only visual information, nor solely feed-
forward information from early visual regions, but also information from other modalities
(e.g. audition), and feedback information from many cortical areas. In addition, the thala-
mus boasts inhibitory mechanisms, allowing to regulate, and thus harmonize multi-modal
information based on several sources, making it a quite collaborative ensemble.

The goal of this chapter is to gather and present information about the early visual
system to establish a ground-base knowledge for further reading of this document, while
at the same time teasing the reader on the importance and interest that started this work.

Keywords: Early visual system, Visual pathway, Thalamocortical loops, Neuroscience.

Organization of this chapter:

After a brief introduction of the early visual system, with basic deﬁnitions and ideas, its
diﬀerent components are reviewed: the retina, the cortex, the thalamus and the superior
colliculus.
In addition, we very brieﬂy discuss the amygdala, as understanding further
visual processing is crucial for the systemic approach we used to conceive the original work
here presented. The chapter is then ﬁnished by refreshing and reinforcing the idea that
the beautiful mess we here study is a circuit of various loops, where diﬀerent interacting
information ﬂows are the actors, and that these actors work at diﬀerent time scales, but
despite all this, it allows us to marvel at the beauty of the visual world.

Introduction: Overview of the early visual system

1.1

The brain is an amazingly resourceful and complex entity. Arguably, the most demand-
ing sense –in terms of processing in the cortex of primates– is vision. However, vision starts
way before the cortex, in what is called the early visual system.

The early visual system has been previously studied sequentially towards the cortex,
but nowadays we know that a series of loops and interacting information ﬂows exist prior
to the processing carried out by the cortex.

The early visual system, in simple words, is the ensemble formed by the retina (in the
eye), the lateral geniculate nucleus and the thalamic reticular nucleus (in the thalamus),
the superﬁcial and deep superior colliculus (in the midbrain), and the primary visual cor-
tex. In addition, as if having quite a few structures was not enough, we should consider
that all these diﬀerent structures hold diﬀerent types of neurons, with diﬀerent process-
ing capabilities and timing... Here the conclusion is that there is a quite complex system
before the cortex, a beautiful mess, called the early visual system, and that in order to
understand what information is fed to the brain, one must embark on the adventure and
sail the complex ocean of studying it. Here, many scientists have observed what are now
called the “standard” information ﬂows, but there is much more to discover when hoisting
the sails to explore the “non-standard” information ﬂows.

In order to provide a deeper understanding of how the early visual system works the
way it does, other regions, such as other cortical areas, the pulvinar and the amygdala, are
also going to be brieﬂy reviewed in this chapter.

The circuitry/architecture of the early visual system is presented in Figure 1.1. Light
penetrates our eyes and is transduced by the retina into a train of spikes after being further
processed within the retina. These electric signals are then rearranged at the optic chiasm1
and sent towards further structures. These neuronal structures are mainly the lateral
geniculate nucleus (LGN), in the thalamus; and the superior colliculus, in the midbrain.
Through LGN, information gets to the primary visual cortex, involving thalamo-cortical
loops. Feedforward information is sent to the cortex, and feedback information is sent
back to the thalamus by cortical areas. These loops are regulated by a structure called
the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), which is not present in Figure 1.1. Through the
superior colliculus, information arrives to the pulvinar (another structure in the thalamus)

1This rearrangement consists in combining the left and right visual ﬁelds, or hemiﬁelds, of each eye into

separated both-left and both-right streams.

and then to the amygdala. The pulvinar also receives and sends information to and from
cortical areas, in thalamocortical loops similar to those of LGN, also regulated by TRN.

All these are the primary structures to what is called “vision for behavior”, which con-
sists not only in regular visual processing for “perceiving”, but also provides the capabilities
to act with the environment in close relation to our body, our needs, and our emotions. Or
simply said, to properly behave.

In a classical viewpoint, vision architecture is based on the two-streams hypothesis
[63]. This hypothesis argues that humans possess two visual systems: the “what” and

4

Chapter 1. Neuroscience of the early visual system of primates

the “where/how” pathways, fed by the Parvo and Magno layers of LGN respectively, that
themselves receive information from midget and parasol ganglion cells in the retina. The
non-standard Konio pathway has been explored more recently, and acts as a modulating
stream along the whole early visual system and beyond, thanks to widespread connections
to various cortical areas.

Let us describe these structures in more detail.

The retina: The smart front-end

1.2

The retina [45] is the ﬁrst non-optical stage of the mammalian visual system.

It is
non-optical in the sense that it is diﬀerent from the cornea and other parts of the eye,
because it transduces light, i.e., converts it into electrical signals.

The mammalian retina is a small tissue located in the back of the eye (Figure 1.3), and is
described as a two layered circuit composed by over 50 anatomically diﬀerent types of cells
[105][106](Figure 1.2). These cells are grouped in ﬁve categories: the photoreceptors, the
bipolar cells, the horizontal cells, the amacrine cells, and the ganglion cells. A connection
between neurons is called a synapse, and the connectivity between these diﬀerent neurons
can be seen in Figure 1.4, where colored dots represent excitatory (black) or inhibitory
(white) chemical synapses, while electrical synapses (gap-junctions) are represented by
those spring-looking symbols, which depict resistors.

Before going deeper in understanding these neurons, one must be reminded a few con-
cepts. We call the retina a two-layered structure (cf. Figure 1.4) for all what happens
1) from photoreceptors to bipolar cells, and 2) from bipolar to ganglion cells. There is a
special place in the retina called the fovea, which covers about 3 degrees, and contains the
neurons that give us the most detailed view we can have of the visual ﬁeld (the human vi-
sual ﬁeld is approximately 160 degrees horizontally and 135 degrees vertically). One should
as well consider that humans have a blind spot, which is basically the retinal surface where
the retinal “output-wire”, called the optic nerve, is created, gathering the information of
our ganglion cells. We do not notice this blind spot, nor the lesser-quality details outside
the fovea, because our eyes move really fast all the time, and also because our brain is able
to reconstruct the scene from all these samples, ﬁlling gaps when necessary, interpolating,
replacing information to make sense of the visual world. And now, let us analyze in more
depth the diﬀerent retinal neurons.

Photoreceptors, as their name suggests, capture photons in the light beam, and com-

Figure 1.3: The road in the retina. Light enters the eye through the cornea –the trans-
parent cover of our eyes–, to then pass through a chamber full of ﬂuid (called the aqueous
humour), in order to reach the iris, which regulates the amount of light that passes through
the pupil, the black “spot” on our eyes. Then, the light rays passing through the pupil
reach the lens, which turns them upside down and, through another liquid chamber, called
the vitreous humour, focuses them into the retina, which is the thin bowl-shaped tissue
in the back of the eyeball. Image taken from [56], itself modiﬁed from the National Eye
Institute, National Institutes of Health.

Figure 1.4: Circuitry in the retina, where P = photoreceptors, H = horizontal cells, B
= bipolar cells, A = amacrine cells, and G = ganglion cells. The neurons in the retina
are connected through chemical synapses that are either sign preserving (excitatory, closed
circles) or sign inverting (inhibitory, open circles). In addition, one ﬁnds a considerable
amount of electrical coupling between cells via gap junctions within all cell classes and
across some types of cells (marked by resistor symbols). The input into the network is inci-
dent light, which hyperpolarizes the photoreceptors. The connections from photoreceptors
to bipolar cells are of either sign, producing both OFF-type and ON-type bipolars. Hori-
zontal cells provide negative feedback and lateral inhibition to photoreceptors and bipolar
cells. Bipolar cells are reciprocally connected to amacrine cells with chemical synapses and,
for some types, through electrical gap junctions. Ganglion cells represent the output layer
of the retina; their axons form the optic nerve. They collect excitation from bipolar cells
and mostly inhibition from amacrine cells. In addition, ganglion cells and amacrine cells
can be electrically coupled. This general connectivity sets the framework for any speciﬁc
retinal microcircuit. Image and caption taken from [62].

Chapter 1. Neuroscience of the early visual system of primates

municate their information to horizontal and bipolar cells. There are two types of pho-
toreceptors: rods and cones. Rods are sensitive to not-so-intense (dim) light in the visual
ﬁeld, and are more numerous as we go away from the fovea, where they are practically
non-existent [118]. This makes them really useful in peripheral vision, and as they are
more sensitive than cones, our night-vision comes almost completely from rods. Cones, on
the other hand, are sensitive to relatively bright light and are most numerous in the fovea,
where they are densely packed [118]. They are also really useful to us as they are sensitive
to color, but as their numbers diminish as we go further away from the fovea, they are
mainly central vision neurons, thus giving central vision the exclusivity of color. Again,
we do not notice this because our eyes move really fast all the time, and because the brain
reconstructs the visual space from all these samples, ﬁlling the gaps when necessary.

Horizontal cells are laterally interconnecting neurons that communicate with photore-
ceptors and bipolar cells. We owe them the capacity to see properly in environments with
bright and dim light, as they integrate and regulate the input from the photoreceptors.

Bipolar cells are versatile cells. Their location is one of the keys to proper retinal
function, as they connect with all 4 other types of cells. However, the communication with
ganglion cells is only feedforward, i.e., it only outputs to ganglion cells, never receiving
any input from them directly. Nevertheless, it could receive information from ganglion
cells indirectly, i.e., coming from amacrine cells that communicate with ganglion cells via
gap-junctions, which are electrical synapses.

Amacrine cells basically regulate bipolar cells, but they are also the main input to
ganglion cells. This is evident when realizing bipolar cells are responsible for about 30%
of the input ganglion cells receive, whereas amacrine cells account for the other 70%.

Ganglion cells are the output of the retina. They integrate information from bipolar
and amacrine cells, and transmit this integrated information to several structures, such
as the superior colliculus or the lateral geniculate nucleus [123]. This communication is
one-way, i.e., there are no feedback connections towards the retina, thus making it a fully
peripheral structure. Due to their importance –they have the central role in integration of
information–, we will analyze them thoroughly in the next sections, but ﬁrst we need to
deﬁne receptive ﬁelds and their role in information integration.

1.2.1 The notion of receptive ﬁeld

When we look at the retinal circuit, and how it maps the visual ﬁeld, one needs to under-
stand the notion of receptive ﬁeld. The receptive ﬁeld (RF) of a neuron is simply the region

9

Chapter 1. Neuroscience of the early visual system of primates

of visual space that will be mapped by such neuron. As stated before, the retinal output
–result of a series of integrations across the diﬀerent cell types– is ultimately generated
by the ganglion cells, thus usually one will speak of the receptive ﬁeld of a ganglion cell
when referring to a retinal receptive ﬁeld. Classically, RFs were considered circular, and
eventually ellipsoidal. Today, this approximation is still used for the geometric simplicity
it implies. However, real RFs vary substantially from this description [58]. In fact, they
have a ﬁne structure and irregular contours that diﬀer from cell to cell, where neighbors
complement each other, as it would happen in a puzzle, meaning that the cell population
is spatially coordinated (Figure 1.5) [58].

Figure 1.5: Receptive ﬁelds with irregular shapes, which allow for a more uniform mapping
of the visual space. Image taken from [58].

Another important point about receptive ﬁelds is that they usually follow an antagonist
center/surround organization. These antagonists are simply called ON and OFF. This
means that we will ﬁnd ON-center/OFF-surround cells, and OFF-center/ON-surround

10

Chapter 1. Neuroscience of the early visual system of primates

cells. The ON part responds to positive changes in intensity (increasing), while the OFF
part does the opposite, i.e., responds to negative changes in intensity (diminishing). So,
while considering that the center will allow for the maximum activation of the neuron, we
can conclude that, e.g., an ON-center/OFF-surround cell will ﬁre the most when only its
center receives light. If both center and surround receive light, the neuron will not ﬁre
as much; while with no light at all, or light only on the OFF-surround part, the cell will
not ﬁre at all. Here, ﬁring means eliciting a spike-train, or simply generating the electrical
signal we have been discussing previously. Now, we are ready to enlarge our knowledge of
ganglion cells.

1.2.2 Standard ganglion cells

Ganglion cells are the output of the retina. For many years, scientists only observed what
now are called standard ganglion cells. This classiﬁcation is given to midget and parasol
ganglion cells, who respectively provide information for detailed perception, and action.

Midget ganglion cells represent around 70%-80% of the ganglion cells’ population
[38][115]. They analyze and provide to the rest of the system information of details and
high-frequency high-contrast in central vision. They are also sensitive to color, and have
slower conduction velocity compared to the parasol cells.

Parasol ganglion cells represent around 10% of the ganglion cells’ population [38][115].
They analyze and provide to the rest of the system motion information, low-frequency
low-contrast, and information from ﬂashing objects. Diﬀerently to midget cells, parasol
cells are insensitive to color, and are faster than midget cells to propagate their output.

1.2.3 Non-standard ganglion cells

Noticed later than their standard counterparts by the scientiﬁc community, non-standard
ganglion cells are considered to be older in the phylogenesis [70], and to provide information
for detection [70][107].

This detection, however, is rough but fast, and focuses on events or particular objects.
Its goal is to induce survival-oriented actions on time [91], and to drive higher-level iterative
processes with prior information [15][86].

Non-standard cells have been found to participate in blind-sight, i.e., where “clinically
blind” patients report being unable to consciously perceive visual stimuli, yet they are able
to accurately detect targets moving slowly, or to roughly localize stimuli [92][34].

11

Chapter 1. Neuroscience of the early visual system of primates

When compared to standard cells, non-standard cells –such as small bistratiﬁed gan-
glion cells– account for about 10% of the ganglion cells’ population [71][84]. Despite the
notorious diﬀerence in proportion against the midget cells, parasol and bistratﬁed cells map
the entire visual ﬁeld thanks to larger receptive ﬁelds [189][58]. Here, Figure 1.6 shows us
the dendritic morphology of ganglion cells in the macaque, and their receptive ﬁelds follow
this fashion in terms of size.

Figure 1.6: Dendritic morphology of macaque ganglion cells. Parasol and bistratiﬁed
ganglion cells compensate for their reduced amount, compared to midget cells, with larger
receptive ﬁelds. Image taken from [39].

We have argued that non-standard cells provide coarse detection capabilities. For in-

12

Chapter 1. Neuroscience of the early visual system of primates

stance, some non-standard ganglion cells are able to produce sophisticated spatial and
temporal pattern recognition on their own [62, 184]. This includes motion detection, direc-
tional selectivity, local edge detection, object motion and looming detection [107][62][184].
Nevertheless, the reliability of the detection is relatively low –it is diﬃcult to identify com-
plex patterns with a single and large RF– and it will have generally to be conﬁrmed by a
subsequent analysis with smaller and more numerous RFs of the standard pathway. These
diﬀerent functions could have developed over time, as researchers have found that during
phylogenetical evolution, the eye was not a simple feedforward system: Feedback informa-
tion from the remainder of the nervous system had been able to produce adaptive learning
of sophisticated visual functions to “optimize the transfer of information” [160]. These
capabilities could have evolved to the point of now being pre-wired, i.e. existent without
any need for adaptation.

In a nutshell, non-standard cells provide fast, a priori event detection assumptions to

the remainder of the visual system [91].

1.2.4 Projections of ganglion cells: The birth of visual pathways

Besides the standard and non-standard classiﬁcation, we can group retinal outputs in
streams, which is a notion we will use for the rest of this document. Under this scheme, we
will have the Parvocellular [16], Magnocellular [16] and Koniocellular [70] pathways. These
pathways start with, and keep the properties of, the information produced by midget, para-
sol and non-standard ganglion cells, respectively. They receive their names from diﬀerent
neurons in the thalamus, which we will discuss later.

An overview of the retinal projections and the pathways being born with them is shown

in Figure 1.7.

Just as a reminder, midget cells and the Parvo pathway carry information for per-
ception, while parasol cells and the Magno pathway carry information for action, and
non-standard cells and the Konio pathway carry information for detection. This is the
key diﬀerence between these three classes, and summarizes well their role throughout the
whole visual system.

Before we review the thalamus, let us describe the stage right above, the cortex, so we

can later easily discuss the thalamocortical aspects and interactions.

The cortex: The adaptable mainframe

1.3

The major processing power of our visual system is kept in the cortex. Like a large
distributed mainframe, the visual cortex computes information to be used by several struc-
tures at the same time, building distributed interpretations/representations of the world,
that are to be composed in higher cognitive levels. For the purposes of this document, we
will focus on the earliest stage of the visual cortex: the primary visual cortex (V1) [18].

V1 is tiled with elementary and repeated neuronal circuits that authors call the cor-
tical column [74]. It is basically a layered structure made by 6 levels, usually grouped as
superﬁcial (composed by layers 1, 2 and 3 upper), middle (3 lower and 4), and deep (5 and
6) layers. Figure 1.8 depicts it in a simpliﬁed manner. Here, it is shown that superﬁcial
layers receive information from other cortical areas and the matrix thalamus, in order to
modulate information processing in the column, respectively, towards a stimulus expected
from cortical inference or roughly detected from the non-standard pathway. Middle layers
receive precise sensory information from the core thalamus, and with the information from
cortical expectation and thalamic modulation, the output will be produced and commu-
nicated through the deep layers towards the thalamus as feedback, and to motor regions,
like the superior colliculus.

As shown in Figure 1.7, V1 receives feedforward information coming from the thalamus
–which will be described in the next section– from all three visual pathways. In addition,
it receives information from other cortical areas.

A summary of the anatomical circuitry and their functions in the early thalamocortical
loops of mammals –used to validate the thalamocortical connections used in our model– is
represented in Table 1.1, adapted from [124] and [67].

In the introduction to this chapter, we mentioned the “what” (perception) and the
“where/how” (preparation for action) pathways [63]. The “what” pathway, also called
temporal –or ventral– stream, is involved with object identiﬁcation. After layer 4Cβ in
V1, information goes through areas V2, V3, V4 and on, towards IT. At the same time,
the “where/how” pathway, also called parietal –or dorsal– stream, is involved with self-
referenced localization (i.e. with oneself as point of reference). After layer 4Cα in V1,
information goes through areas V2, V3, V5/MT and on, towards MST and FEF. All these
links, pathways, and their interactions, serve to integrate information and achieve more
and more developed processing at each higher stage.

Regarding the temporal propagation of waves [93][91], again we can take into account

are represented, just to give an idea of the interactions of the cortical column with other
structures. TRN stands for thalamic reticular nucleus, and core and matrix thalamic
structures are explained in section 1.4.1. The superﬁcial layers receive information from
other cortical areas and the matrix thalamus, in order to modulate or bias processing in the
column towards an expected, or unexpected, stimulus, respectively. Middle layers receive
information from the core thalamus, and with the information from cortical expectation
and thalamic modulation, the output will be produced and communicated through the deep
layers towards the thalamus as feedback, and to motor regions, like the superior colliculus.

the “slower what” and the “faster how” streams, where the prior focuses in hierarchical
processing (i.e. sequential), and the latter on preparing action processing (with a more
parallel processing). These streams focus on the interpretation of the visual scene, where a
hypothesis is developed by grouping information from the diﬀerent receptive ﬁelds in order
to “make sense of the environment” (see Figure 1.9). This process of binding information in
the current hypothesis is another way to look at what a cortical expectation is. A cortical
expectation is a certain information “predicted” by the cortex, and “expected” to be there,
or to happen. An example would be for us to expect to see a ball that is thrown moving
in a more or less straight line, rather than to see it moving like a serpent during its ﬂight.

The thalamus: The collaborative harmonizer

1.4

The thalamus [146] is a structure in charge of regulating the information ﬂow to cortical
areas. It is located between the cortex and the midbrain, and communicates with several
cortical and extra-cortical areas, including peripheral structures, such as the retina. It is
thanks to all these connections, and what it does with them, that we call it a collaborative
harmonizer.

The thalamus is composed by diﬀerent clusters of neurons, each one called a thalamic
nucleus. Figure 1.10 shows an overview of thalamic nuclei, while Figure 1.11 is a schematic
of their diﬀerent connections. From these nuclei –and in the scope of the present document–
the most important are the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the pulvinar, and the thalamic
reticular nucleus (TRN).

To give a brief ﬁrst idea:

from a functional point of view [115], LGN works like a
smart relay of retinal information, while the pulvinar does something similar with cortical
information. TRN, however, will not relay any information and instead will regulate –by
inhibiting the thalamus– the thalamocortical ﬂows from, and to, LGN and the pulvinar.

Another important fact is that the thalamus will allow for a “current thalamocortical
hypothesis” to exist. This is nothing else than the current information being processed, that
is formed thanks to the feedforward ﬂows. The feedforward hypothesis will be corrected
through feedback information, particularly the one coming from expectations and goals
(cf. Section 1.4.1).

Figure 1.9:
cortical interactions This ﬁgure represents a simpliﬁcation of the interaction between
information ﬂows, i.e. the interplay between feedforward and feedback information, to-
gether with local receptive ﬁeld integration, and expectation corrections done through
higher-level receptive ﬁelds. Left: The upper rectangle represents a higher-level unit (of
V2, here), where the lines and the ellipse represent its receptive ﬁeld, that consider 3 cells
of a lower-level structure (of V1, here). Two of these cells identify a horizontal stimulus,
while we delay the processing of the cell in between them to show how receptive ﬁelds,
feedforward information, and expectation, work to deﬁne the output of a certain unit by
integration. This delay could also be interpreted as uncertainty due to noisy or inconsistent
signal. Here, this middle unit can identify 4 types of orientation, as represented by the lines
in the smaller squares. Middle: The cell locally evaluates the preferred orientation, scoring
the largest for a diagonal, being this the local feedforward hypothesis. However, it is de-
picted in the upper box that the higher-level unit, by grouping, has established a straight
horizontal line as stimulus, and thus the expectation information (cf. Section 1.4.1), rep-
resented by the descending link, will force the unit to be “corrected” and ponder higher
the horizontal line, despite the local score, and because of its global, higher-level, analysis.
Right: The scores are no longer considered, and the units are in synchrony analyzing a
horizontal line.

Chapter 1. Neuroscience of the early visual system of primates

1.4.1 Properties of thalamic structures

In order to better characterize thalamic nuclei, one must be ﬁrst aware of the jargon used to
describe them. Here, we will discuss their classiﬁcation by order (ﬁrst/higher order)[153],
types of cells (core and matrix)[80][81], what their activation modes are (tonic/burst)[154],
and how connectivity allows us to label their outputs (as driver or modulator)[154]. In
addition, we will discuss the “no strong loops” hypothesis for thalamic (and cortical) pro-
jections.

First and higher-order nuclei

When we talk about order, we simply mean “what input”. This makes ﬁrst-order equal to
peripheral, like we see with LGN receiving input from the retina, and higher-order equal
cortical, like we see with the pulvinar receiving input from the primary visual cortex (V1)
and other cortical regions.

Core and matrix cells

When we talk about core or matrix cells, we look at “where and how it outputs”. The
reason for having only two names rather than four is that cells project in only two ways.
The ﬁrst one, used by core cells, consists in projecting topographically to middle cortical
layers (3 lower and 4), which is called the “precise” way. The second one, used by matrix
cells, consists in projecting non-topographically to upper cortical layers (1, 2, 3 upper),
and it is called the “diﬀuse” way. In addition, this diﬀuse way also considers other areas
in the cortex.

Core cells produce driving ﬂows, while matrix cells produce modulating ﬂows (cf. Sec-

tion 2.1.2).

Tonic and burst modes

The information transmission modes of thalamic neurons were ﬁrst studied in slow-wave
sleep [148]. Here, bursting was of major interest, where scientists observed these sustained
rhythmic bursts across large cell populations, where the ﬁring was synchronized. The ﬁrst
observations showed that bursting prevented the normal function of the cells, which at the
time was considered only to be relaying information, through the tonic mode. However,
in awake activities, a thalamic neuron will transmit information in tonic and burst mode
(one of them being active at the time) [147].

24

Chapter 1. Neuroscience of the early visual system of primates

The tonic mode is the linear transmission mode, where ﬁring is somewhat regular,
and thus it is considered that sensory information is transmitted via this mode. On the
other hand, the burst mode is the non-linear transmission mode, where bursts improve the
signal-to-noise ratio, and are thus thought of allowing the capture of new information.

These modes are supposed to be generated because of intrinsic properties of the thala-
mic neurons. Particularly, because of calcium (Ca2+) conductances in their T-type calcium
channels. A T-type calcium channel is a low-voltage activated “tunnel” that allows for a
calcium inﬂux to enter a cell after a spike or a depolarizing signal. Here, depolarization
is when the membrane potential of the cell becomes “more positive” or “less negative”,
while its conductance is a mathematical parameter representing the ease of electric cur-
rent ﬂow through this channel. So, these modes happen thanks to a threshold: when a
cell is relatively depolarized for 100ms or more, T-type calcium channels are inactivated,
thus allowing cells to ﬁre in tonic mode. However, when a cell is relatively hyperpolarized
(opposite of depolarized) for 100ms or more, T-type calcium channels are activated, and
provoke the burst mode, where 2 to 10 spikes are generated per burst. Here, the excitatory
cortical input (from layer 6) promotes tonic ﬁring, while the inhibitory input from TRN
promotes burst ﬁring [104].

Our interpretation is that the burst mode comes in handy when looking for something

new. This “something new” is linked to cortical expectations.

When cortical expectations are not met, we call it a mismatch. In order to say whether
there is such mismatch, or not, feedforward information must be compared to the expec-
tations, reﬂected by feedback information. This task is topographically carried out by
TRN –receiving feedforward and feedback ﬂows to compare reality against expectation–,
who possesses inhibitory capabilities to regulate thalamic nuclei. In the case TRN resolves
that there is no mismatch, sensory information can be transmitted through tonic mode.
However, in the case of a mismatch, the burst mode is needed to improve the SNR, and
to either validate cortical expectations by realizing that the mismatch is not as great as
previously computed, or to allow for a topographically wider search in the information, as
the SNR increase would provoke a larger inhibition in the mismatching regions, allowing
for this search elsewhere in the topographic map.

Driver and modulator information ﬂows

An information ﬂow can be either a driver, or a modulator. Being a driver means that it
will, by itself, be responsible for generating/modifying the current output of the receiving

25

Chapter 1. Neuroscience of the early visual system of primates

structure. An example would be the output of core cells in the LGN towards layer 4 of V1.
This information ﬂow alone triggers cortical responses, altogether with being considered
for ﬁrst-order thalamocortical mismatch. A modulator, on the other hand, is unable to
trigger a response by itself on the receiving structure, and instead will regulate (modulate)
what is already being analyzed. An example would be the output of matrix cells in the
LGN towards layer 1 of V1. This information ﬂow will help to regulate, or empower (being
excitatory), certain regions, but will not be directly responsible for the output, and will
not be considered for the ﬁrst-order thalamocortical mistmatch.

All this could be put in situation : driver information from the lateral geniculate
nucleus, e.g. encoded in the Magno pathway, will be transmitted in tonic mode unless
the thalamic reticular nucleus sends a modulating mismatch signal, which would require
to block (maximal inhibition) the feedforward ﬂow, switch to burst mode, and allow for a
search elsewhere than the current focus point (or a new interpretation).

The “no strong loops” hypothesis

This hypothesis for thalamic and cortical projection establishes that there shall be no loops
created only with driving information ﬂows, as the consequence of having one would be
uncontrolled cortical oscillations [35]. This hypothesis arises from graph theory, where the
mathematical theory of directed graphs, or digraphs, is used. A digraph is a series of nodes
(and in our case, thalamocortical structures) connected by lines, where each line shows the
direction of the information transmission with an arrow. Here, if a digraph has a directed
loop (i.e. loop with only driving information ﬂows, in our case), then it is not possible to
generate a hierarchy of levels. On the other hand, if there is no directed loop, the nodes
(structures) can form a hierarchy, but it may not be a unique one.

In our case, this simply means that a stable system should not have such loops, and

the early visual system does not contain any so far [35].

1.4.2 The complex relay: the lateral geniculate nucleus

LGN, or the lateral geniculate nucleus, is a ﬁrst-order nuclei, composed by both core and
matrix cells. In primates, it is composed by 6 main layers, where intralaminar structures
are found between them. In layers 1 and 2 we localize Magno-cells, in layers 3-6 the Parvo-
cells, and Konio cells are present in the intralaminar structures. The core part of LGN is
composed by the 6 main layers, while the intralaminar structures are its matrix part.

26

Chapter 1. Neuroscience of the early visual system of primates

In a previous section we discussed the midget, parasol and non-standard ganglion cells,
and saw that these cells gave birth to the Parvo, Magno, and Konio pathways. Taking this
into account, it is not surprising that the diﬀerent cells in LGN share many properties of
their retinal counterparts (cf. Figure 1.7):

• The Parvo cells carry slow and sustained neuronal activity for layer 4Cβ of V1 con-

cerning color and shapes.

• The Magno cells carry rapid and transient information for layer 4Cα of V1 concerning

motion, brightness and depth.

• The Konio cells process diﬀerent kinds of non-standard information and project to

upper layers in the cortex. The next section is dedicated to them.

In addition, core LGN receives strong cortical feedback from layer 6 of V1, together with
a degree of inhibition from TRN. All these can be seen in Figure 1.12. This, we interpret,
as a result of the mismatch between feedforward and feedback information (expectation).

1.4.3 Konio pathway and its projections

The Konio stream, or non-standard pathway, is here considered as “for detection”. This
raw, coarse, a-priori detection of visual events is done by integrating information from
groups of non-standard retinal ganglion cells. The results of this detection can allow for
survival actions to be done promptly [91], and also to drive higher-level processes with
prior information [15].

Here, the Konio pathway is considered to be a quick pathway. This consideration
does not arise from its processing speed, as we will see in the last section of this chapter,
but instead from the reduced number of hops when compared with its Parvo and Magno
counterparts.

There are 5-6 classes of Konio axons2 aﬀerent to V1. However, they seem to be orga-

nized in 3 Konio streams [24][70]:

• The dorsal Konio layer, that carries low acuity information and projects toward layer

1 of V1.

• The middle Konio layer, that carries information from central blue cones to layer 3B

of V1.

2An axon is the nerve ﬁber of a neuron that allows it to transmit electrical impulses.

Chapter 1. Neuroscience of the early visual system of primates

• The ventral Konio layer, that is linked to superior colliculus and pretectum functions.

In addition, Konio cells connect, through LGN, to important multi-sensory structures like
the amygdala. This region, in mice, is involved in the control of emotion [31], e.g.
fear
behavior, which is the behavior against fearful stimuli, which is detected globally.

Another behaviorally interesting characteristic of the Konio pathway is its participation
in Blindsight [92][34], where the detection of moving targets and rough localization of
stimuli are done subconsciously.

For the purpose of this document, Konio cells are particularly important for their
modulation of the ﬁne core information V1 receives from the Parvo and Magno pathways.

1.4.4 The inhibition center: the thalamic reticular nucleus

TRN, as mentioned previously, has a main role in regulating thalamocortical communica-
tions [90]. As shown in Figure 1.11, TRN somewhat wraps the rest of the thalamus, and
most of the thalamocortical connections pass through it.

Receiving a duplicate of the thalamic feedforward driver information in what is called a
“collateral” connection (or simply collateral), while at the same time receiving a collateral
from cortical feedback information, TRN will inhibit both core and matrix thalamic nuclei
if a mismatch is found. This inhibition will regulate thalamic processing in a topographic
way, respecting the diﬀerent resolutions from the diﬀerent nuclei [154].

In addition, the synchronization carried out by TRN works at many levels at the same
time. For example, it is cross-order, meaning it uses information from ﬁrst and higher-order
structures. It could also take into account other modalities, such as audition, which makes it
multi-modal. This multi-level inhibitory mechanism is the result of three main components:
GABAergic cells, cross-order local gap junctions3 and inhibitory axons [150][82] (cf. Figure
1.12).

1.4.5 The higher-order thalamic nucleus: brieﬁng of the pulvinar

The pulvinar is, in terms of vision, our higher-order thalamic nucleus. It is a collection of
core and matrix cells that receives input from many cortical areas, and outputs to their
immediately higher-order successor (e.g. V2 in case of V1). It also receives input from
the Konio cells and the superior colliculus, and it is also regulated by TRN. Regarding

3That allow for direct electrical connections.

29

Chapter 1. Neuroscience of the early visual system of primates

these facts, one could easily argue that it is pretty similar to LGN, which is true, however
learning, that make it earn its
the pulvinar has quite a few other characteristics, e.g.
classiﬁcation as a higher-order nucleus.

The pulvinar seems to be involved in visual spatial attention, where it would play a role
in the initiation and compensation of saccades (eye movements) via its participation in the
shift of attention [128]. It also participates in emotional processing, as part of the superior
colliculus→pulvinar→amygdala pathway. These two structures, the superior colliculus and
the amygdala, are discussed in the following sections.

The superior colliculus: The early sensory-motor hookup

1.5

The superior colliculus (SC) [109] is particularly devoted to eye movements [190][98], or
oculomotricity. The SC, or optic tectum (or simply, tectum), is located on the roof of the
brainstem, and it is a layered structure that respects visual topography. There are various
eye movements, and for the scope of this document we will focus on saccades, which are
rapid eye movements that bring a region of interest into the foveal (with highest resolution)
region.

The visual inputs of the superior colliculus are the retina and the visual cortex, while
it projects motor outputs to the brainstem, reticular formation and spinal cord to perform
orientation movement.

Primitive visual processing, such as the one of the frog [99], is still present in mammals
[41]. In such processing, non-standard ganglion cells consider only movement information
and visual memory is restricted to objects staying in the visual ﬁeld (cf. primitive detection
functions by the Konio pathway). They are often called “event detectors”. Two behaviors
are particularly relevant for such system: gaze shifting, where saccades, head movements or
other skeletal segments can be engaged [57]; and stereotyped defensive responses conserved
across species [43].

Its superﬁcial layers (e.g. 2a and 2b) are connected to sensory systems, mainly the

visual one, and they shelter cells specially tuned for movement [88].

Its intermediate layers are linked to multi-sensory and motor systems, carry out multi-

modal integration, and are mainly devoted to the control of eye movements.

The deep layers drive the motor system, generating a motor map. Here, saccade ampli-

tude (in primates) is represented logarithmically4, from the rostral to the caudal extents,
and saccade direction is represented linearly on the other axis [97]. Their main role in
vision is to control fast displacement of gaze. At any one time, only one saccade can be
performed (with an average of three saccades per second [7]), and this most convenient
saccade is chosen taking into account criteria from reactive behavior to planning.

Several projections to the thalamus reach the striatum (in the basal ganglia), for the

selection of motivated orientation (including saccadic) movements.

The amygdala: The mnesic and emotional muscle

1.6

Most of our behaviors are regulated by our desires, needs (including survival), etc.
This is also true for visual behaviors, where subcortical structures play an important role,
inducing neurophysiological changes and inﬂuencing behavior towards relevant stimuli –
e.g. reﬂexes, or prioritizing the analysis of a target against others–. To comprehend how
emotional information modulates processes in the early visual system, cortex included, it is
thus necessary to assess the relevance of each component of the visual information, and to
thus propose a behaviorally relevant model. To this end, we must mention the amygdala.

1.6.1 A few facts about the amygdala

The amygdala [96][164][40][83] participates in many behavioral functions, such as memory,
decision making, and emotional reactions. Part of the limbic system, it is an almond-like
shaped region in the medial temporal lobe, and achieves its goals thanks to numerous
connections with other brain areas [139].

1.6.2 Amygdala and perception: attention and (un)awareness

As the sensory inputs gather massive amounts of information, ﬁltering its irrelevant parts
becomes crucial for perception. This is usually called selective attention, and has com-
monly been used for conscious perception, when top-down5 inﬂuences from frontoparietal
structures suppress cortical activity in these irrelevant regions. However, a healthy brain

intrinsically possesses mechanisms to perceive emotional stimuli non-consciously as well,
and thus, bypasses the relevance constraints because emotionally relevant stimuli, such
as fearful stimuli, are prioritized in a task [182].
In the adult brain of humans, several
subcortical areas are involved in non-conscious perception of emotional stimuli (Figure
1.13). Visual encoding of emotional stimuli follows a path through the superior colliculus,
the pulvinar, and then the amygdala, to continue to the substantia innominata and the
nucleus accumbens.

[164].

Under this scheme, the superior colliculus responds to coarse emotional stimuli, the
pulvinar responds to salient visual targets, and the amygdala has been studied mostly
regarding responses to danger, but also responds to stimuli such as happy or surprised
expressions, though in a diﬀerent manner when compared to fearful stimuli [158]. The
diﬀerence between these structures resides in the fact that functional neuroimaging studies
show that the amygdala is involved in both conscious and non-conscious perception of emo-
tional stimuli, whereas neither the superior colliculus nor the pulvinar seem to participate

Chapter 1. Neuroscience of the early visual system of primates

in non-conscious perception, with the exception of the non-standard pathways [145].

Temporal aspects of the early visual system

1.7

Naturally, when having a system with many actors, one of the interesting aspects is
interactions. These structures manage their timing for precise operations by exchanging
information, coordinating diﬀerent processing, including behavioral responses adapted to
emergencies, etc. Timing is the tracking of time when these operations are happening.
Here, the (early) visual system processes information promptly: a complex natural image
may be processed as fast as 75-150ms [170][177].

Normally, one measures these processing times in what is called latency, which is simply
the amount of time between stimulation and response. Here, we use latency as the time
since information was presented to the eye. This means that one can get estimates of local
processing times by simply subtracting the previous stages.

The whole visual processing starts in the retina, where the midget cells, part of the
Parvo pathway, have a center latency of 40-50ms, delayed 3-10ms because of its surround
[84]. The parasol cells, part of the Magno pathway, are faster, with a latency of around
25ms [89][30]. The retinal Konio cells evoke latencies of about 40-60ms in vivo [36], but
[49] shows in vitro latencies of about 50-70ms. These results correspond to those shown
by [37].

In the thalamus, the Magno cells have a latency of about 33ms, while the Parvo cells
show a latency of about 50ms [143][116]. [108] postulates that even if the Magno pathway is
about 10ms faster to reach the cortex than the Parvo pathway, the convergence of the Parvo
cells in the cortex could compensate for, or even reverse, the time advantage shown by the
Magno cells. As for the Konio cells, in the Galago, they have a latency 10ms longer to that
of the Parvo cells [77][116]. Cells in the Inferior Pulvinar (PI), Lateral Pulvinar (PL) and
Dorsomedial Pulvinar (Pdm) show latencies of about 66, 64 and 84ms respectively [121].
TRN cells begin to act in the ﬁrst 100ms after stimulus onset [138] and have a processing
time of about 25ms [111].

Cortical areas show latencies (see [116] for a review, and [91] for a very nice meta-
analysis over 48 diﬀerent studies) of about 65ms for V1, 83ms for V2, 71ms for V3, 102ms
for V4, 71ms for V5/MT, 74ms for the medial superior temporal area (MST), 72ms for the
frontal eye ﬁeld (FEF) [143], 100ms for the lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) and 110ms for
the inferior temporal cortex (IT) [116]. [136] shows latencies of 40-60ms for V1, 50-70ms

33

Chapter 1. Neuroscience of the early visual system of primates

for V2, 60-80ms for V4, 70-90ms for TEO and 80-100ms for TE (TEO and TE are part of
the inferior temporal cortex). These diﬀerent results could be explained due to the diﬀerent
experiments performed -e.g. the results of [116] for IT were obtained with ﬂashed stimuli,
while on [136] moving stimuli were used-, with diﬀerent stimuli and setups, but all were
obtained from the primate system.

In the superior colliculus, superﬁcial layers show latencies of 40-80ms, whilst deep
layers (combining visual and motor modalities) show latencies of 50 to 150ms [188]. As
regular saccades take 130-180ms in being produced [44], and by simple subtraction, this
would mean that the latencies of deep layers are the about same values if we consider
their activation from superﬁcial layers.
[101] shows that if a target moves “twice in brief
succession” there is a delay in the response of about 150ms, but that the SC cells encode
the delay of this second saccade, as the motor burst coincides with the saccade.

The dynamics just mentioned are summarized in Table 1.3.
Considering the previous numbers, we can understand the hypotheses of works such as
those of Lamme ([93][91]). There, the temporal stream towards IT (linked to the Parvo
pathway) could be regarded as with a more sequential processing, whereas the parietal
stream, including MT, MST and FEF (and linked to the Magno pathway) could be con-
sidered more parallel in its processing.

To summarize, one can notice how fast the Magno pathway is, compared to the Parvo
pathway in every stage, and that despite the diﬀerences in timing, the interactions between
all the diﬀerent participants is a challenge that should be taken into account without any
central structure, as they all work locally in an “independent” fashion. These are:

• Hierarchical elaboration of object identiﬁcation along the Parvocellular pathway.

• Preparation of action, in a parallel way, in the Magnocellular pathway, which also

depends on object identiﬁcation.

• The Koniocellular system can make interruptions if speciﬁc stimuli are detected

(alert), or can modulate processing if a mismatch is detected.

It is using these temporal dynamics that the work presented in this thesis will be

conceived and developed.

Summary: A circuit of loops and interacting ﬂows

1.8

We have seen many facts about the early visual system in the previous sections. Perhaps
an idea that should be emphasized is that of interacting information ﬂows in a system
composed of loops.

We here consider three main sensory information ﬂows: the one linked to the Parvo
pathway, the one linked to the Magno pathway, and the one linked to the Konio pathway.
The ﬁrst noticeable interactions take place at the primary visual cortex, V1, where standard
information ﬂows are modulated by the non-standard information sent from the matrix
LGN. This modulation is also present in other cortical stages, where the pulvinar has a
role similar to LGN, however adapted to higher order areas.

The stream linked to the Parvo pathway arrives at the temporal cortex to further
communicate to the limbic system. It parses visual information into discrete objects related
to memory, where a link between present input and stored information is established.

There are two Magno related streams. The ﬁrst, after the parietal cortex, communicates
to the somato-sensorimotor cortex, and specializes in extracting information to prepare and
calibrate current action. The second, together with the Konio pathway, sends information
to the superior colliculus and then to the reticular formation to regulate orientation and
saccades.

There are several Konio related streams, and they are partially understood. One of
them is the one starting at the retina, projecting to the superior colliculus, then to the
pulvinar and subsequently to the amygdala. This stream is able to give emotional value to
stimuli, to allow for learning, and also to send information to, e.g., the basal ganglia, for
further processing.

In terms of loops, probably the most notorious in the early visual system are the
thalamocortical ones. For the standard pathways, the thalamus sends direct information
to the cortex, who sends feedback information directly to the thalamus. In addition, these
connections generate mini-loops including synchronization from TRN, as the feedforward
and feedback collaterals allow for the mistmatch computation to be carried out, closing
the loop with the resulting inhibition. For the non-standard pathway, however, this loop
is less obvious, as matrix cells project their output to superﬁcial layers in V1, and the loop
will be also closed with inhibition from TRN, but this inhibition will consider standard
information (as it is the result of the mismatch mechanism).

A not-so-obvious loop is the peripheral one. Since eye muscles will be operated by

36

Chapter 1. Neuroscience of the early visual system of primates

signals from the superior colliculus, retinal information –from parasol and non-standard
cells– arriving at this structure could have an “immediate” (considering biological/reaction
delays) impact on the collicular response. This means that what the retina will capture
next, as the retina is a ﬁxed tissue in the eye, will also be modiﬁed, and thus we have
another loop.

The last loops we will discuss here are the ones created by cortical output arriving at
the superﬁcial layers of the superior colliculus. These information ﬂows participate in the
computation of the signals that will be sent to LGN and the pulvinar (cf. Section 1.5),
who themselves will project to the cortex, thus closing the loops.
All these diﬀerent properties are included in our modeling.

Summary

The complexity of a model indeed depends on the related scientiﬁc objective. What
does this system represent? Which task is performed? What is it composed of? At which
level of detail should one represent its internal mechanisms? ... These are only four of the
many questions that will arise when building a model. And the choices of implementation
at the “how to” level are deﬁnitely in deep relation with the “what for” speciﬁcation level.
More precisely, when modeling the early visual system, we must account for the diﬀerent
types of neurons, how they are grouped in populations, and at a higher scale, how the
related networks process diﬀerent kind of information, at diﬀerent timing. This yields the
functional view of the nervous system. For each point, simpliﬁcation is mandatory for
both pragmatical and methodological reasons, since our goal is to create a minimal, yet
complete, systemic model. Despite these simpliﬁcations, interesting properties emerge. In
order to study them it is crucial to specify how such model is evaluated and validated.

The goal of this chapter is to provide answers to these issues within the scope and

context of this thesis.

Keywords: Neural Ensemble, Emergent Properties, Natural Images, Computational
Modeling

Organization of this chapter:

Here, we discuss the “how to” of neuron population implementation. We make explicit
the issues that must be taken into account. We focus on the early visual system. The
diﬀerent tools (formalism, software architecture, etc.) used to develop this implementation
are described. Notations used in the rest of the paper are also given here.

The way we propose is to start from the smaller scale up to the global scale, i.e., from
individual populations of neurons, to networks, and ﬁnally the system as a whole. Between
each scale, the emergent properties are to be discussed. Furthermore, timing in information
processing is a key issue, addressed here. Stability and computation convergence of this
distributed computation are also included.

We, in addition, have to discuss topics in link with these computations: the fact we
consider natural images, which is a major inﬂuence for the whole architecture and properties
of the system, and the use of statistical learning implemented as a biologically plausible
mechanism in order to explain the intriguing capability of the ganglion cells to perform

Implementing populations of neurons: the notion of min-
imal model

When implementing a neural ensemble, one faces many challenges. The primary ques-
tion is basically the level of detail to be achieved. This decision directly impacts the
complexity of the processing in most cases.

A reasonable decision is to develop a minimal model. But what does minimal mean?
And what for? The generic answer is to choose the minimal level of details and complexity
(i.e., minimal number of parameters, equations, etc.) that allows us to reproduce the stud-
ied phenomena, i.e. the available experimental data. This is the Occam’s razor principle
[169]. This choice has several virtues. On the one hand, estimation is more robust (e.g.,
the risk of numerical instability is reduced and the numerical signiﬁcance of the estimation
is higher). A step further, it avoids the risk of “over-ﬁtting” the data [169]. A model
with enough degrees of freedom to predict everything, simply predicts anything, and this
explains nothing. On the contrary, a minimal model takes a risk in terms of prediction.
Because it is highly constrained, it yields precise predictions about results not yet obtained.
Also, it is falsiﬁable. These predictions can be tested during future experiments and the
model is going to be a-posteriori conﬁrmed or contradicted.

This major methodological aspect is going to be applied at diﬀerent stages of our work.
In the next section, it is going to drive the choice of neural model. When working with
neurons, one of the ﬁrst decisions is whether our neurons are to be represented by a spiking
or a rate model. The scale of representation –either each neuron, or a group of neurons (e.g.,
a micro-column in the cortex) that have the same input/output behavior, or macroscopic
variables representing the whole neural map activity– is the major issue.

2.1.1 Spike vs rate models: why we have made the standard choice

When considering a neural network, the designer can choose to build a model based on
spiking neurons, or opt for a rate model, which by default consist of looking at the system
under very diﬀerent time scales. Let us discuss these options, and the reasons why we
ﬁnally decide to use the rate model one.

In a spiking neural network, neurons have at least one state variable: the membrane
potential V , which controls the ﬁring of the neuron, in the sense that when a threshold
membrane potential is reached, the neuron ﬁres a spike. The simplest model that im-

41

Chapter 2. Bio-inspired dynamical systems and algorithms

plements this minimal representation of such a phenomenon is the integrate-and-ﬁre (IF)
model. It writes:

˙V (t) = −

1
τ

V (t) − e− 1

τ δ(V (t) − 1) + U (t), V (0) = 0

where τ > 0 is the neuron leak time-constant, U (t) the input normalized current and δ()
is the Dirac distribution. A straightforward computation shows that when V (t) < 1 the
system behaves as a 1st-order integrator of the input current, i.e., an exponential low-pass
ﬁlter:

t

ds e− t−s

τ U (s)

V (t) =

Z

0

while, when V (t) = 1, integrating in the sense of the distribution leads to the fact that
V (t) is instantaneously reset to 0. This discrete event corresponds to the fact the neuron
has ﬁred a spike, i.e., an action potential. This minimal model of a spiking neuron has
been proposed by Louis Lapicque [95], in 1907.

When considering discrete times, i.e., when sampling the time at a period ∆T < τ ,
the same model writes, using an elementary forward Euler discretization scheme ˙V (t) ≃
V (t+1)−V (t)
∆T

:

V (t + 1) = γ (1 − H(V (t) − 1)) V (t) + U (t), V (0) = 0

where γ = 1 − ∆T
τ ∈]0, 1[ is the discrete time constant, while the term (1 − H(V (t) − 1))
implements the potential reset mechanism (here H() stands for the Heaviside function), as
easily veriﬁed. This model is called the BMS model and has been extensively used by Cessac
and collaborators to study dynamical properties of neural networks or reverse-engineering
of neural networks parameters [25][29].

When used in a network, the state of each synapse is taken into account in the input

U (s) and the minimal representation writes for a neuron of index n:

Un(t) =

Wnm H(Vm(t) − 1)

Xm

where Wnm is the synaptic strength for the aﬀerent neuron of index m to the eﬀerent
neuron of index n, while the use of the Heaviside function allows to take into account the
fact the information is transmitted only when the neuron spikes.

It is interesting to provide the reader with this level of detail for a couple of reasons.
- This is really a good example of a minimal model, and the references show that a lot
can be learned even with such a simple choice. For instance, choosing a simple model does

42

Chapter 2. Bio-inspired dynamical systems and algorithms

not mean it is a “trivial” model. In this case, complex neural network dynamics emerge at
a higher scale [25], while it has been shown that the programming of such network in the
deterministic case is equivalent to a precise algorithmic problem (namely a LP-problem)
[28].

- In the sequel, at the macroscopic scale of cortical and sub-cortical maps, we are going
(with the reset mechanism) to reuse the same basic derivation to propose a minimal 1st
order implementation of time-delays as observed in biological experimentation.

A step further, in 1952, Hodgkin and Huxley proposed a conductance-based model
–commonly known as the HH model–, which describes how spikes are generated and trans-
mitted directly between neurons. It can be thought of as a diﬀerential equation with four
degrees of freedom that vary with respect to time t. The system is non-linear and cannot
be solved analytically. However, several numerical methods are available to analyze it.
The four state variables of the system are v(t), n(t), m(t), and h(t). Respectively, they
represent membrane voltage, potassium channel activation, sodium channel activation, and
sodium channel inactivation. In this case, since there are four state variables, visualizing
the path in the phase space is not trivial. Usually, one can plot 2 variables at a time, where
a limit cycle can be visualized. However, this method is ad-hoc to visualize a 4-dimensional
system, and thus does not prove the existence of the limit cycle. A better way to study
it is to analyze the Jacobian of the system, evaluated at the equilibrium point. In this
case, the eigenvalues of the Jacobian indicate the existence of the center manifold, while
the complex eigenvectors reveal the orientation of this manifold. This is because, despite
having 4 dimensions, the system collapses onto a two-dimensional plane, since there are
two negative eigenvalues, and their associated eigenvectors reduce to zero as time increases,
while the other two eigenvalues are complex and have slightly positive real parts. In this
case, any solution starting oﬀ the center manifold will decay towards the center manifold,
and the limit cycle will be contained on the center manifold.

If one considers the injected current I to the membrane as the bifurcation parameter,
the HH model undergoes a Hopf bifurcation. Here, increasing I leads to increasing the
ﬁring rate of the neuron. However, because of the Hopf bifurcation, there is a minimum
ﬁring rate. Also, as the cells will ﬁre when stimulation surpasses a certain threshold (the all-
or-none law), there occurs a canard transition [183], which is a sudden jump in amplitude,
giving the characteristic wave form of the HH model.

Since this model is not a minimal model, many simpler diﬀerent models, such as the

FitzHugh-Nagumo model and the Hindmarsh–Rose model have been developed.

43

Chapter 2. Bio-inspired dynamical systems and algorithms

The FitzHugh-Nagumo model [79] is a two-dimensional simpliﬁcation of the HH model.
Its motivation is to extract the essential mathematical properties of excitability and prop-
agation described by the HH model.
Its advantage is that while in the HH model one
can visualize projections of its four-dimensional phase trajectories, the FitzHugh-Nagumo
visualization allows to observe the full solution. This allows to geometrically analyze the
behavior of the neuron. The main drawback of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model is that it is
not as realistic as the HH model, which is biophysically plausible, or, in other words, that
it is too mathematical. This is not really a great drawback, considering it is a great tool for
studying neural behavior, as discussed previously. In addition, there are several variants
of this model too. One example is the one shown in [51], where the focus is on cooperative
variables, and adding the calcium dynamics to account for more types of excitability than
previously shown. Also, the passage from a HH model to this variation of the FitzHugh-
Nagumo model is straightforward, and presented in detail in [52], while the importance of
the inclusion of calcium dynamics is presented in [46].

The Hindmarsh–Rose model [72] aims to study the bursting behavior of a single neu-
ron. To this end, it uses a system of three dimensionless ordinary diﬀerential equations.
The three variables x(t), y(t) and z(t) represent the membrane voltage, the fast sodium
and potassium behavior, and the behavior of slow (e.g. calcium) channels. Its advantage
is that it is relatively simple, while providing a good qualitative description of the neural
dynamics. Its drawbacks are that, as with the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, it is not biologi-
cally plausible, and that it presents unpredictable behaviors, such as chaotic dynamics, if
its eight parameters are not tuned properly.

Let us now focus, not on the model, but on the information coded in such a network.
All neurons ﬁre action potentials. The main simpliﬁcation is to assume that neither the
shape, nor the magnitude of the action potential, but only the time when such event occurs
matters. This appears to be a fairly good approximation on the whole nervous system.
This is mainly due to the fact that shape and amplitude are approximately ﬁxed and
stereotyped for a given neuron.
In the case of chemical synapses, the relevance of the
assumption is also related to the fact that the emission of the synaptic neurotransmitter is
somehow a “all-or-nothing” mechanism: The neurotransmitter emission does not depends
on the action-potential shape.
In the case of gap junction (i.e., an electrical synapse)
models that maintain this assumption appears to be still relevant [32].

As a consequence, spike is the code [127]. However, do all spike times matter? The main
aspect is that spike time precision is bounded [27]. As a consequence, this code is of rather

44

Chapter 2. Bio-inspired dynamical systems and algorithms

limited precision and in coherence with Bialek pioneer works, the authors have shown than
the information rate of such code is below 1 Kbyte per second per neuron, even when
taking all spike times into account. This weakens somehow enthusiastic positions about
rank order coding [120][42] or “liquid state machines”.

A step further, the answer really depends on the neural sub-system, and on non-
trivial timing characteristics. An extreme situation is the early vision system in fast brain
paradigm. In this situation, one spike is enough to trigger high-level categorization of an
object [170] (which does not mean that other spikes do not matter). In the retina, using
natural images, it has been experimentally established [113] that the spike code is sparse
and reproducible: Spike times matter, in this situation. Furthermore, in the retina, spike
synchronization is directly related to local image segmentation since homogeneous zones
correspond to ganglion cells that ﬁre in phase [62]. The fact that spike times and synchro-
nization is an important cues in the nervous system front end is coherent with the fact
that such spikes are generated by coupled mechanism. On the other hand, in the basal
ganglia for instance, up to our best knowledge [126], the neural structure aﬀerents are so
diﬀerent that spike synchronization is entirely blurred. This happens because they come
from totally asynchronous parts of the brain, and various diﬀerent stages of the processing
of sensory input. This fact has an important consequence for us: though we are going to
consider spike synchronization from retinal input at a mesoscopic level, when considering
feed-backs from brain areas non-directly connected, it seems that we can forget about such
synchronization.

In such cases, only the spiking rate matters. A rate code focuses on the mean ﬁring
rate, which is a temporal average, i.e. the number of spikes that fall in a time window,
In other words, rate corresponds to the 1st
divided by the duration of this window.
order momentum of the time distribution. At a probabilistic level, the rate is simply the
marginal probability that the neuron ﬁres at a given time, irrespective of all other cues.
The rate code has been broadly used for over 80 years. One point is the simplicity to
measure rates experimentally, whereas multi-electrodes devices break this barrier. A more
important point is that rate captures well-identiﬁed information in several parts of the
brain: from sensory-input (the ﬁltered image intensity in the retina or the sound frequency
band magnitude in the cochlea) to the motor output (e.g., the muscle contraction driven
by motor neurons). Another important fact is related to modeling: while the mathematics
of spike times is unusual, based on discrete event system formalism for instance in the
deterministic case [129], or on sophisticated stochastic derivations in the probabilistic case

45

Chapter 2. Bio-inspired dynamical systems and algorithms

[122], using rates allows to reduce the information provided by a neuron to a simple real
number. It must be pointed out that this is not only “the simplest simpliﬁcation”. Rate
models are formally derived, using the rigorous mean-ﬁeld formalism [26] and the model
reviewed in the sequel of this chapter is directly coming from such works.

At this stage, how can we reconcile rate models with the fact that input synchronization
matters? The answer is given by the fact that, as far we are concerned, beyond rate,
the main temporal information is spike correlations, i.e., 2nd order momenta of the time
distribution [127]. Up to 80% of the information is represented by 1st order (rates) and
2nd order momenta. This means that we not only consider a scalar representation (i.e. a
unique number) of the neuron activity, but a vectorial representation at the network level.
Considering the retinal output, as already mentioned, the situation is even more precise:
we need the rate and phase [62], the latter allowing to code for the grouping of regions.
This has been extensively studied in a collaboration realized at the beginning of this thesis
[168].

In this work we consider mainly rate models, plus additional scalar quantities to take
into account speciﬁc phenomena. Interactions of interlaced information pathways in the
system of brain loops only consider rates, because as other authors we can assume with no
risk that spike synchronization is blurred, at least at our level of description.

2.1.2 Driver/Modulator considerations

In 1998, Sherman and Guillery proposed that we can distinguish two types of inputs to
cortical neurons; drivers and modulators. Driver signals are carried by fast ionotropic
receptors, whereas modulators correspond to slower metabotropic receptors [151]. These
two forms of input help to explain how, for example, sensory driven responses are controlled
and modiﬁed by attention and other internally generated feedback signals. However, the
distinction between driver and modulator inputs is mainly functional and changeable rather
than anatomical and ﬁxed. Driver inputs are carried by excitation and inhibition acting
in a push-pull manner (increases in excitation are accompanied by decreases in inhibition
and vice versa) [1].

Modulators correspond to excitation and inhibition that they increase or decrease to-
gether. A step further, [54] proposes a link between feedforward/feedback connections and
the driver/modulator property.

In [54] the visual cortex is considered as a hierarchy of cortical levels with reciprocal
extrinsic cortico-cortical connections among the constituent cortical areas [48]. The no-

46

Chapter 2. Bio-inspired dynamical systems and algorithms

tion of a hierarchy depends upon a distinction between forward and backward extrinsic
connections. This distinction rests upon diﬀerent laminar speciﬁcity [130][140].

In this context, forward connections are driving and backward connections are modula-
tory, as suggested by reversible inactivation [141][60] and functional neuro-imaging [13]. In
some paradigms, backward connections may also be functionally driving the signal if their
latencies are shorter than forward connections between distant cortical maps [171]. This
fact is compatible with the present formalism.

More precisely, forward connections are concerned with the promulgation and segre-
gation of sensory information, consistent with: (i) their sparse axonal bifurcation; (ii)
patchy axonal terminations; and (iii) topographic projections. On the other hand, back-
ward connections are considered to have a role in mediating contextual eﬀects and in the
co-ordination of processing channels, consistent with: (i) their frequent bifurcation; (ii)
diﬀuse axonal terminations; and (iii) non-topographic projections [140] (iv) slow time-
constants.

Backward connections are more numerous and transcend more levels, e.g. the ratio
of forward eﬀerent connections to backward aﬀerents in the lateral geniculate is about
1:10/20. Another example: there are backward connections from TE and TEO to V1
but no monosynaptic connections from V1 to TE or TEO [140]. Backward connections
are more divergent than forward connections [191], one point in a given cortical area will
connect to a region 5-8mm in diameter in another. For instance: the divergence region
of a point in V5 (i.e. the region receiving backward aﬀerents from V5) may include thick
and inter-stripes in V2, whereas its convergence region (i.e. the region providing forward
aﬀerents to V5) is limited to the thick stripes [191]. They are faster than direct lateral
connections [116]. As a consequence, forward connections preserve retinotopy in visual
areas, whereas backward connections do not [14].

This is summarized by [54] as reported in Table 2.1.
Following [14], we must emphasize the fact that cortical visual processing requires
information to be exchanged between neurons coding for distant regions in the visual
ﬁeld. Feedback connections from upper-layers are best candidates for such interactions
because Magnocellular layers of the LGN very rapidly project a “ﬁrst-pass” information
used to guide further processing in IT. One step further, [5] demonstrate that the so called
“horizontal connections” (i.e. within a cortical, e.g. retinotopic, map) are not fast enough
to account for such a transfer, considering the known timings of information transfer [116].
More generally [54], feedback connections are essential when the relationship between

Table 2.1: Forward/Backward connections connections main properties, from [54]. Post-
synaptic/modulatory eﬀect is a conjecture, so is assumptions on synapses mechanisms.

retinal inputs and the stimuli that generate them is not invertible. This is the case for
practically all situations of vision outside the laboratory because of the interactions between
the stimuli and the importance of the context for a given stimulus [54]. In the work of
Rao and Ballard[125], the way internal representations and incoming signals are combined
is mainly subtractive : only diﬀerences are transmitted to higher levels. However, all
studies of feedback connections so far [14] converge to conclude that feedback inﬂuences
act to potentiate the responses of neurons at lower levels. In our framework, this occurs
by tuning the cortical map parameters, formalized now.

The question here is to analyze such interactions when considering regularization mech-
anisms, i.e. study how our model may be used considering several interacting cortical maps.
If we focus on the thalamus, not all aﬀerents to thalamic relay cells are equal, and it
is important to identify which input carries the information to be relayed. The retinal
input to the lateral geniculate nucleus and medial lemniscal input to the ventral posterior
lateral nucleus are drivers because of their ionotropic characteristics (cf. beginning of this
Section). All other inputs, as being feedbacks, such as those from layer 6 of cortex and the
midbrain, are modulator inputs and determine how driver inputs are relayed.

48

Chapter 2. Bio-inspired dynamical systems and algorithms

A step further, one aspect of this modulatory role is the control of the ﬁring mode
and its switching between tonic and burst [148]. The ﬁring mode concerns all cells in
LGN (Parvo and Magno [148], but also Konio [181]) and is controlled by cortical feedback
connections [148] and TRN [90]. The functional role of this switch might be related to
proper information transmission and processing, as pointed out in [148]. One goal of the
present work is to analyze this assumption, considering the early visual system as a whole.
Regarding LGN and pulvinar, as the pulvinar has many similar points with LGN, but
receives cortical information (from several areas) instead of peripheral (retinal) information,
these ﬁring modes are also controlled by the cortex and TRN. The functional role of these
modes could be the same as in LGN, but for cortical information.

In the retina, the standard cells project to the core cells in LGN, while non-standard
cells project to the matrix cells in LGN. In addition, parasol cells project to the superior
colliculus. Standard retinal cells code characteristics such as color, contrast, motion and
texture, while non-standard retinal cells code coarse prediction, segmentation and looming
motion, among others.

A step further, this duality of input types might be applied to other brain pathways.
One instance is the glutamatergic pathways in cortex [115] where this driver/modulator
distinction holds. For example, information arriving at the cortex from the Magno cells
of LGN is ﬁrst sent and processed in the parietal cortex. Only then, lower visual areas
(V1 and V2) carry on with their processing, i.e.
information is retro-injected from the
parietal cortex to guide, modulate, further processing of Magno, Parvo, and Konio-related
information [14]. These feedback ﬂows are modulatory, since they do not directly generate
an output, but instead allow for the modulation of the selectivity or specialization of these
lower-order areas [55]. These considerations are useful for our work as we implement
local topographic modules, where the diﬀerent information ﬂows will interact following the
driver/modulator classiﬁcation.

In our work, we propose a minimal implementation of the fact that driving information
is regarded as a base term, while modulators are considered as multiplicative/additive.
The basic equation we consider writes

y = d ∗ (1 + m)

The output y depends directly on d, the driving signal, while the modulatory part acts as
a gain adjustment. The multiplicative sign ∗ may stand for either a simple local multipli-
cation (i.e. a gain) or a local convolution. The latter choice allows us to implement the

49

Chapter 2. Bio-inspired dynamical systems and algorithms

fact that modulatory feedbacks are divergent and also correspond to a spatial ﬁltering of
the upper layer information.

2.1.3 Speciﬁcation and validation of parameter values

Minimal model also implies to keep a reduced set of parameters. Here, we reduce adaptation
gains and limiters (lower or upper bounds, i.e. threshold and saturation) to a minimal set.
This is obtained by the following generic speciﬁcation choices:

• all quantities are normalized to avoid any oﬀset/gain scale change,

• linear models (i.e., without additional parameterized non-linear bounds) are used,

except if non-linearity is mandatory1,

• spatial and temporal convolution kernels are avoided when the related temporal or

spatial scale is negligible,

• each parameter is speciﬁed with a default value (e.g., oﬀset to zero, gain to unity,

etc) and modiﬁed only if required.

This is the reason why our “y = d ∗ (1 + m)” is proposed keeping the amount of

parameters to a minimum.

Despite these factors, these simpliﬁed conditions precisely correspond to eﬃcient results
regarding our numerical experiments on real images. This will be a major result of this
work.

A step further, numbers have to be chosen. They are, indeed, taken from biological
data. However, not the value but the value range or order of magnitude is meaningful.
In our case, we have use the simple, deterministic (avoiding probabilistic formalism) but
systematic design choice.

• A prototypical value is chosen from the literature

• Model performances are systematically tested for each parameter value variation,

with the following rules:

1. If a small (say, ±10%) variation impairs the performances or qualitatively change

the system behavior, this means that the model is inappropriate

1Provided by the literature, or part of the hypothesis with corresponding justiﬁcation.

50

Chapter 2. Bio-inspired dynamical systems and algorithms

2. If a large (say, ±100%) variation does not aﬀect signiﬁcantly the performances,

this means that the parameter is

– either useless, thus set to a default value,

– or a scale constant, used to map one numerical range to another, also set

to a ﬁxed value

3. Otherwise, this means that the parameter is meaningful for the given model

A model is thus numerically inappropriate if a tiny value change impairs the obtained
behavior. This does not correspond to the biological reality, where parameter value vari-
ability is widely observed. This also means that the model is not robust, i.e. it behaves “by
chance” as expected. Equivalently, it means that the model predicts unexpected spurious
behaviors, thus is not a pertinent representation of the observed phenomenon.

A systematic test of parameter values has been conducted, as ensuring stability is an
important component for the performance of the simulation. To test this aspect, we simply
vary each parameter in the simulation and run it again, once for every change, so as to
check how results diﬀer due to this variation. This could be a healthy measure as well to
recognize if a parameter is not adding anything to the result, so as to remove it and/or
modify the computation accordingly.

Here, variations of -100% to +100% are used for the parameters, where in most cases
they cause only violations of bio-plausibility –meaning a unit has more than 100% activation–
however some instabilities have been encountered, and are reported in Section 4.2.2.

2.1.4 Filters and information processing

Any device transmitting part of its input to its output can be called “a ﬁlter”. This includes
transforming the signal, removing part of it, and the broad idea here is that the essential
features of the analyzed stimuli are kept, while some parts are enhanced, diminished or
simply modiﬁed.

Specially relevant for this work are spatio-temporal ﬁlters. Considering image pro-
cessing, spatio-temporal ﬁlters will be mainly used for smoothing, via convolution with a
certain kernel (matrix). This “smoothing” is also a way to interpret the processing in a
receptive ﬁeld (cf. section 1.2.1) computation, where information from neighbor cells in the
structure is taken into account for the computation of the output of the analyzed neuron.
Motion ﬁlters follow a similar idea, where information from a region yields the output
of a unit, computing temporal diﬀerences (i.e., velocity related information). The emphasis

51

Chapter 2. Bio-inspired dynamical systems and algorithms

in analyzing motion is obvious, it is a diﬀerent functional treatment, but the principle is
the same: removing the useless information (contrast, etc..) and only considering motion.
We, obviously do not claim that this is suﬃcient to encounter for early-vision and
cortical-vision processing (see [47], for a complete modeling of visual motion processing).
We claim that this is the minimal fallback speciﬁcation, and we will observe that it is
numerically suﬃcient for the thalamus modeling (while more sophisticated mechanisms
are required at the visual front-end level).

The spatial ﬁlters we employ are generic Gaussian ﬁlters, while the temporal ﬁlters
are exponential ﬁlters. These choices are to keep the model minimal. A generic isotropic
Gaussian ﬁlter can be expressed by a spatial convolution kernel of the form:

f (x) = a e(cid:18)

2

− |x|

2 c2 (cid:19) + b,

where a, b, c are real variables, i.e., the ﬁlter gain a, oﬀset b, and width c (i.e. radius). It
is a minimal representation of smoothing.

A generic exponential temporal ﬁlter is represented by a temporal spatial convolution

kernel of the form:

f (t) = e− t
τ ,

where τ is the time constant for the exponential decay. It is a minimal, ﬁrst-order, diﬀeren-
tiable representation of a delay, comprising both the processing time, and the transmission
time in one value.

Here we use three information incoming ﬂows, and their retinal implementation [186]
(cf. section 2.2.1) is particularly interesting. Diﬀerential motion ﬁlters are used to compute
the Magno-like information, where not the optical ﬂow but image intensity temporal dif-
ference is computed. It thus accounts for positive or negative variations only (i.e. without
the direction of the movement vector). Spatial ﬁlters are used for the Parvo-like informa-
tion, where the idea is to estimate the image contrast. This is easily generalized to color
(i.e., multi-channel images), though for this version of our work we only use the image
monochrome contrast, but color intensity information. With such a linear model, three
important features of these two retinal standard pathways are neglected: Contrast gain
control [187], saturation and threshold. This is however acceptable in our context.

On the contrary, a combination of diﬀerent ﬁlters is not suﬃcient when considering the
Konio related information processing [62]. In this case, non-standard retinal ganglion cells
processing includes a combination of motion, contrast, and color information, to account for

52

Chapter 2. Bio-inspired dynamical systems and algorithms

the pre-wired stimuli they are tuned to (cf section 2.2.1) and more sophisticated algorithmic
modules are to be considered.

2.1.5 Dynamic Neural Fields

Neural ﬁelds are tissue level models that describe the spatio-temporal evolution of coarse
grained variables such as synaptic or ﬁring rate activity in populations of neurons [33].

The underlying Dynamic Neural Field (DNF) theory is mainly concerned with the
functional modeling of neural structures where information is considered to be encoded at
the level of the population rather than at the level of single neurons. Such models ﬁrst
appeared in the 50s, but the theory really took oﬀ in the 70s with the works of Wilson
and Cowan [185] and Amari [4]. At the level of a single neuron, the model that is used
is a mean frequency model, while the electrical activity of a neuron is approximated by a
single potential. However, there also exists several spiking neuron models that represent
In the framework of
both a ﬁner and more accurate model of a real biological neuron.
the DNF, such models allow to bypass the inherent limitations brought by mean frequency
models [137], this being taken into account via vectorial neural state [12]. Furthermore,
neural-ﬁelds also allow to consider high-level representation of cortical computations [180].
These models most generally use excitatory recurrent collateral connections between
the neurons as a function of the distance between them and global inhibition is used to
ensure the uniqueness of the bubble of activity within the ﬁeld [133]. They exhibit so-
called bump patterns, which have been observed in the prefrontal cortex and are involved
in working memory tasks [53] or high-level cognition [166].

The dynamics of pattern formation in lateral-inhibition type neural ﬁelds with global
or local inhibition has been extensively studied in a number of works where it has been
demonstrated that these kinds of ﬁelds are able to maintain a localized packet of neuronal
activity that can, for example, represent the current state of an agent in a continuous space
or reﬂect some sensory input feeding the ﬁeld [133]. A step further, the linear response of
neural ﬁelds to localized inputs subject to ﬁnite propagation speeds has been studied in
[75]. The characteristic behavior of such ﬁelds is the formation of very localized packets of
neural activity that tend to represent some consistent information which is present at the
level of the input [66].

The main computational properties (see e.g., [133] for a review) of such neural ﬁeld are:

1. ﬁltering of the output bump shape: increase versus decrease of size, volume, etc.

53

Chapter 2. Bio-inspired dynamical systems and algorithms

2. selection of the output bump among several input bumps,

3. tracking of a moving input bump at the output level,

4. remanence of the output bump after the partial or total suppression (inhibition) of

the input bump.

We are going to consider ﬁltering and selection behaviors in this contribution and discuss
the tracking and remanence mechanisms also.

Here, we use them as a “summarizer” of how the cortical column works, as well as the

mechanism how the deep superior colliculus chooses the most salient stimulus.

Let u(x, t) be the membrane potential of neuron x at time t, f a transfer function, y
the distance between neurons x and x′, v the velocity of an action potential along axonal
ﬁbers, and w a lateral kernel function. Then, the evolution of u(x, t) is given by:

Dynamic neural ﬁelds (DNFs) evolve dynamically under the inﬂuence of sensory inputs
as well as strong neural interaction, generating elementary forms of cognition through
dynamical instabilities. Through DNFs one can establish links between brain and behavior
–such as decisions regarding saliency–, and thus the modeler can derive testable predictions
and provide quantitative accounts of behavior. This is our aim when using them in the
cortex and the deep superior colliculus.

Functional view of the neural system: the systemic level

2.2

2.2.1 Functional interpretation of retinal mechanisms: non-local ﬁltering

Understanding the retinal output, i.e., the output of the diﬀerent networks that end in the
retinal ganglion cells, keeps challenging scientists, nowadays more than ever. One approach
could be to observe the retina at a mesoscopic level, where the properties of the diﬀerent

54

Chapter 2. Bio-inspired dynamical systems and algorithms

cells are comprised within the network, with an emphasis in the function of the biological
tissues, like explored in [168].

Since the main biological constraint of the retina in terms of information transmission
is the 102 compression factor for Parvo cells up to 103 for other GCs in the optical nerve,
reducing the noise with respect to the signal is a major issue. The noise added by the photo-
transduction mechanism is obviously to be ﬁltered, but what is to be considered as signal
versus noise in the incoming visual ﬂow is task dependent. For instance, the background
motion induced by ego-motion is a “noise” with respect to object motion recognition but
a relevant signal with respect to gaze stabilization (the optokinetic reﬂex for instance has
the background motion as main input cue). Furthermore, there is a “local” notion of
noise (i.e., a random spurious additive signal, locally correlated in space and time, or not),
but regarding the visual perception, there are other notions: A notion of “outliers” (i.e.,
spurious piece of signal not to be taken into account to avoid bias, e.g., a spurious light
reﬂection) and a notion of “inliers” (i.e., piece of signal coherent with the ground base data
but inducing a misperception, e.g., a shadow.

The concept of noise reduction is no more related to a local ﬁlter, but to non-local
operators, since the context matters. In other words, ﬁltering means estimating a given
zone in the image, thus to perform image segmentation. This non-local idea of ﬁlter-
ing corresponds to the grouping of homogeneous information, reducing small or spurious
non-signiﬁcant variations, and then produce a reduced representation in which outliers are
eliminated because they are not homogeneous with respect to the information neighbor-
hood, while inliers are grouped in another region to be further treated as signal or noise
depending on the perceptual task. Such mechanism of synchronization is well-known in
the retina [61][155]. In a nutshell, spiking rate of GC for the signal intensity and inter-GC
synchronization codes from the fact they correspond to the same signal region. In other
words, the relative phase between the periodic GC spiking generators code for the region
indexing. This is in relation with the fact that shared noise from photo-receptors is a major
cause of correlated ﬁring [65], so that synchronized GC outputs correspond to activity with
the same stochastic signal characteristics.

Furthermore, it is important to point out that we do not group regions of homogeneous
“intensity” but regions of homogeneous response to the 2D+T ﬁltering discussed above,
e.g., of the intensity, intensity variation, contrast, local edge or motion pattern, etc. It
is important to remark that time, here, is considered only as a local feature. As a con-
sequence, such mechanism should be able to segment on complex local spatio-temporal

55

Chapter 2. Bio-inspired dynamical systems and algorithms

patterns. In particular, as very nicely explained in [62] after [73], texture motion, even if
the average local intensity remains constant, is locally detected: During texture motion,
diﬀerent intensity-variation cells respond at diﬀerent time to diﬀerent spatial patterns at
their receptive ﬁeld locations, showing the same activity proﬁle, inducing a cumulative
eﬀect related to strong rectiﬁcation (summing only positive responses in the neighborhood
with both excitatory and inhibitory responses).
It is a perspective of this work to nu-
merically verify that texture motion is also compatible with such variational approach, as
discussed by [117]. This is, however, a rather easy task since such cue is easily computable
by such variational approaches [6].

In [168], a variational framework is implemented as a simple mechanism of diﬀusion in
a two-layered non-linear ﬁltering mechanism with feedback. The goal is to capture speciﬁc
functionality, such as a response adapted to the stimulus, the reduction of non-local noise
(i.e. segmentation), and the detection of visual events. For this last point, several visual
cues are taken into account: contrast and local texture, colors or edges, and motion. The
work presented in [168] was developed with a special interest in natural images.

To achieve such goal, computer vision methods are used, using the two-layered network
mentioned previously as the input transducer, where the visual event detection is carried
out by a prototype-based non-linear diﬀusion algorithm.

As discussed in section 2.1.4, these motion cues are grouped and used depending on
what information ﬂow is treated. In the case of the midget cells (part of the Parvo pathway),
the cues are image contrast and color bands –though we only use the contrast one so far
for this pathway–. In the case of parasol cells (part of the Magno pathway), the cue is
diﬀerential motion. And in the case of non-standard cells (part of the Konio pathway),
cues of contrast, color and motion are used to provide the coarse detection capabilities of
these cells (cf section 1.2.3).

2.2.2 Functional interpretation of retinal mechanisms: visual event de-

tection

The retina is able to detect sophisticated visual events such as:

(i) Fine spatial information, as observed qualitatively with natural image sequences,
a GC being often either silent or sparse by deterministic ﬁring for a given image
category [159];

(ii) local approaching motion, which is known as being computable by a local divergence

56

Chapter 2. Bio-inspired dynamical systems and algorithms

ﬁlter [162], i.e., the weighted sum of dedicated local masks.

Such a functionality includes anticipation, either motion extrapolation or omitted stim-
ulus response [144], these complex computations coming about through the interplay of
rather generic features of retinal circuitry [62]. In both cases, as expected, spatio-temporal
pattern yields adaptation (delay reduction in the former case, response habituation in the
later) and an unexpected event induces a strong reaction. The time window order of magni-
tude is the second. This is thus not directly derived from a 2D+T ﬁltering mechanism (its
temporal window being too short) but by a local fading memory of previous input, thus us-
ing regressive feed-backs, and the simpler model we propose here is a simple auto-regressive
mechanism. The key point is that this induces a switching mechanism, the detection of
a visual event modifying the local parameters on the retina. With [62] we assume that
the switching “may be initiated by much more subtle image features”, precisely by the
detection of a given visual event.

Regarding the detection of such fast visual event, it has already been investigated
in detail how GC and subsequent layers can produce early responses to a visual event
[177][171]. We assume here that, if such a mechanism is able to produce a detection
at early stages in the visual system, it is likely produced by a large contribution of the
retinal processing. This is plausible because the corresponding bio-plausible most eﬃcient
computational method is a one layer method implementable a simple non-linear ﬁlter with
threshold eﬀect [179]. This is related to the so-called Support Vector Machine (SVM)
algorithm, and the bio-plausible implementation is a simple competition between units
coding similarities with respect to prototypes. This may be implemented as a two steps
process: correlation with prototyping responses and competition between the outputs, as
implemented in a standard one-layer architecture with lateral inhibitory connections, which
is the case of the OPL.

We do not study here how the retina has learned throughout evolution to recognize such
events (remembering that the retina of animals, before that of mammals, was provided with
feedback of descending pathways from the brain, which has probably played a role in this
learning process). But referring to the statistical learning theory and the related SVM
algorithm [179] allows us to assume that only a little set of prototypes has to be recruited
for the detection of an event. Moreover, “approximate” prototypes are suﬃcient, since the
prototype of a category can be wrong as far as it is less wrong than a prototype of another
category. It is thus reasonable to assume that this is a biologically plausible functional
model of the retina, since it is able to detect rather complex spatio-temporal visual events.

57

Chapter 2. Bio-inspired dynamical systems and algorithms

As already pointed-out, the major argument is that it is pertinent to use the full retinal
resolution to perform the recognition before the optical nerve spatial compression.

This view is also coherent with the observation that in the presence of natural stimuli,
GCs have a sparse and deterministic behavior. Sparse because they react in terms of
detection of not a given visual event. Deterministic in the sense that they ﬁre a spike
response at reproducible times. This is also coherent with observations already reviewed
that the response is not limited to a “local visual ﬁeld”, since there is no signiﬁcant visual
events at such small case, but at higher sizes of the visual ﬁeld. The fact that the response
of Konio cells corresponds to events in a 10deg of the visual ﬁeld seems properly tuned to
natural visual events [70].

In machine learning, a support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised learning model
with algorithms that analyze data and recognize patterns. In our work, it will be used as
a classiﬁcation tool.

Given a few training sets (groups of stimuli, manually classiﬁed into categories), an
SVM algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples into the categories, making it a
non-probabilistic linear classiﬁer. The idea is that these categories will be represented in
an N-dimensional space with clear separations, where new examples can be mapped, and
thus their category predicted.

Basically, in this work an SVM is used for stimuli discrimination in non-standard gan-
glion cells, part of the Konio pathway. Considering that the training mechanism used for
them can be considered transparent2, an SVM is well suited to allow for a multi-dimensional
categorization, where an N-dimensional space with sub-spaces for the diﬀerent categories
will be generated. This tool is then applied topographically, thus having a non-standard to-
pographic categorization mechanism to analyze the diﬀerent regions of the incoming visual
scene. The resulting information will be used as the non-standard retinal output.

In [179], the authors present a Hebbian Learning Rule for an SVM classiﬁer. This
means that neurons can strengthen their synapses through adaptation to stimuli, and
thus “learn”. In our case, however, as we stipulate non-standard ganglion cells have pre-
wired mechanisms, we want this learning to be done beforehand, and not to be modiﬁed
afterwards. The principles used in [179] are reused in [168] (cf. section 2.2.1), giving us
the ﬁrst step to generate our mold to shape the pre-wired mechanisms here considered.

2Since they are considered having pre-wired mechanisms, and thus the training is done before the actual

simulation.

In order to train such a classiﬁcation tool, diﬀerent “training sets” are given to it,
where a multidimensional space is evaluated, so as to have a clear separation between the
mappings of the diﬀerent training sets. For the sake of simplicity, though not really a
proper practice, one can use a few samples of the real stimuli to generate the categories for
the training set as in [179] and [168]. The situation is robust enough for this to be eﬃcient,
as visible also in our result. This is a good argument in favor of the fact we propose here
a robust mechanism of categorization.

2.2.3 Functional interpretation of thalamic mechanisms

The thalamus is here considered only as composed by LGN and TRN. Considering that
it is the synchronization center between retinal, collicular, and cortical information, the
relevance of the computations here carried out deserves a deeper explanation.

Intuition, inspired by [67] and others, leads us to develop a mismatch algorithm for
TRN. Since TRN receives both retinal feedforward, and cortical feedback information, one
can think that the following inhibition to LGN will target the elements that are not really
being considered in the cortical analysis, so as to help with the processing of the “important
information”. However, an alert mechanism ﬁrst developed in the retina, and veriﬁed by
the superior colliculus, can override this “importance”, and allow for other information to
be prioritized. For example, when an organism is feeding itself, and a predator is suddenly
detected attacking this organism. Here, an action must be carried out as soon as possible,
or else the organism could have an unhappy ending on site.

The core part of LGN is by default a relaying one. However, when including cortical
feedback, inhibition from TRN, and the collicular alert signal, the computation paradigm
shifts accordingly. Out of these three, the one not precisely considered here is the ﬁrst, the
cortical feedback. This ﬂow serves as a reinforcer for “important information”, enhancing
its treatment with excitatory modulation [181].

The matrix part of LGN is by default a modulatory one. With non-standard ﬂows of
information as input and output, this structure will transmit a modulatory signal to the
cortex, that may include an alert, result of the detection of threatening stimuli without
perceptual awareness [100]. Intuitively speaking, out of all the possible “important” targets
(retinal prewired stimuli, cf.
section 1.2.3), it should topographically detect one, and
transmit it, so these targets can be prioritized.

2.2.4 Assembling populations into networks

Once having local models for cell populations formalized as neural maps, connectivity
betwen such maps is the way distributed larger-scale functions are implemented.

Here, a prime complexity is the concurrence of structures with diﬀerent timings. Fast
raw processing allowing to raise the alert and interact with slower more detailed computa-
tions, allowing the system to perform pertinent behaviors. This timing aspect includes both
processing bandwidths and delays of the diﬀerent structures to communicate the present
data, the latter as a function of the processing time and transmission delays.

Another complexity is related to the diﬀerent resolutions that interact (e.g. Parvo,
Magno and Konio pathways have small, middle and large resolutions), with divergent and
convergent links. As detailed in this chapter, each functionality is implemented at a suitable
resolution. As a simple example, there is a need to detect a predator urgently, but no need
to detect precisely its location since the induced behavior (run for your life!) only needs
the rough escape direction.

These two computational aspects are included inside an architecture with loops, in-
cluding feedbacks, as made explicit previously. So the task is a beautiful one: to have
everything working properly considering phenomenological models, taking the real neural
architecture and biological constraints into account.

The issue is not only putting all modules together in order to make them work, but
to construct a global view of the functionality of the system. Unfortunately, at this level
of complexity there is no closed-form result that guaranties stability and convergence, and
we must proceed using heuristics. Let us detail our method:

• Ensuring stability: Fighting against loops Basically, two potential issues that

can arise from loops: accumulation and persistence.

– Accumulation, i.e. unbounded drift, corresponds to the fact that, within a loop
in continuous work, certain variables potentially keep increasing (or decreas-
ing), without regulation. Implementing saturation mechanisms, de facto avoids
–but does not solve– the problem (yielding system blocking or oscillations, etc.).
Here, we use another design choice: consider as much as possible linear oper-
ators in loops. In such a case, ensuring stability is a well-deﬁned and known
task, with straightforward solutions. When non-linearity is introduced we easily
maintain the stability since they add more bounds. This simpliﬁcation is equiv-
alent to upper-bound our non-linear system by a stable linear system. This

60

Chapter 2. Bio-inspired dynamical systems and algorithms

design choice includes the thalamocortical loop, which could have potentially
non-stop increments of signal value as the internal connections could have kept
feeding the cortical feedback, but that remains stable in our model (as in the
biological reality).

– Persistence means that a certain variable value stays circulating in the loop
without vanishing, despite not existing in the input anymore. This property
is indeed precious for short-term memory, e.g., taking previous contextual data
into account. The problem here is to control this persistence. For example,
when a mismatch is detected, the feedforward information transmitted again
via a feedback is important to detect the mismatch, but has then to be can-
celed (see section 1.4.1). The key-point, in such a case, is to change the system
regime: A thresholding mechanism takes care of introducing fast temporal de-
cays. This is implemented very naturally via a driver/modulator mechanism:
The driving inﬂuence of the input, as the feedback is modulating, can be can-
celed/maintained depending on the task.

Indeed, in both cases, there is no external mechanism (supervisor) checking these
values: it is an emergent property of the system. Furthermore, we have experimented
a very simple but powerful method to numerically “ﬁght against loop”. The idea is
to start with a system in open-loop (choosing a minimal set of connections cut in
the network graph). The knowledge of the phenomenological role of each sub-system
helps ﬁnding the pertinent cut. Then we incrementally close the loops (no more than
ﬁve in our model) and can numerically verify both accumulation and persistence.

• Ensuring convergence: How to stack modules All modules need to be thor-
oughly stacked to ensure everything will work as a solid structure. Let us consider
the two main points: resolution mapping and information fusion.

– Resolution mapping corresponds to the fact that due to convergence and diver-
gence connectivity, there is an ability to “zoom” in or out the processed data.
Making the diﬀerent maps congruent with each other is straightforward. Less
obvious is the eﬀect on the dynamic. As carefully studied by [180] on a generic
example, spatial diverging feedback acts as a temporal stabilizer, avoiding in-
troducing temporal delays. Let us detail this key point: When a closed-loop
oscillates, one trick is to increase the feedback delay which decreases the oscil-
lation frequency up to a non-oscillating bifurcation. However, this is not a very

61

Chapter 2. Bio-inspired dynamical systems and algorithms

eﬃcient choice, in terms of system reactivity. Here we do not consider a punc-
tual system but a data ﬁeld. If spatial ﬁltering is introduced, local oscillations
are averaged by other random values and, providing the system is not feed-up
with a constant homogeneous value, stability is obtained. Each unit beneﬁts
from neighbors thanks to such linear kernels.

– Information fusion, in this context, aﬀects processing in two ways, the driver/modulator

computation paradigm (cf. Section 2.1.2) and, beyond, the fact that diﬀerent
cues are bound together, for instance the Magno-related and Parvo-related mo-
tion and contrast data (“related” because they correspond to the same area in
the visual ﬁeld). Here, a simple linear mixing of the two data maps does the
trick. This is a strong limitation, since we do not take into account the physics
of the information. For instance, when combining contrast magnitude with in-
tensity variation (i.e., Parvo and Magno) we obtain optical ﬂow information.
This combination is however not linear, and it has to be computed as the ratio
of the latter by the former [47]. Luckily enough, this is going to be suﬃcient in
our numerical experimentation as we focus on visual gaze (saliency).

Dealing with loops is thus a speciﬁc topic. Knowledge comes from the literature, where
the diﬀerent anatomical connections are described, and the only major consideration here
is the “no-strong-loops hypothesis” (cf. section 1.4.1). Since we cannot provide a priori
information about what happens in such a complex system, this work aims to recreate such
an auto-organizing system, in order to experiment (using numerical experiments) what is
observed in terms of stability of loops.

2.2.5

Implementation details

Though, it is admitted that thanks to evolution, more complex capabilities have emerged
for the whole network by natural essay and error, i.e. mutations in interaction with self-
system organization [119], the PhD duration was a bit short to wait for our system to
auto-program the required modules by itself. Computational models do not have the time
to evolve and the modeler has to compensate with good approximations and faster learning
algorithms.

In the case of the work presented in this thesis, and through the systemic approach,
each component is modeled in a simple but bio-plausible way and integrated, to this end,
as a dynamic asynchronous ensemble of modules. This is built on top of DANA [132],

62

Chapter 2. Bio-inspired dynamical systems and algorithms

a framework specialized in such distributed processing mechanisms, where each unit is
considered as a set of arbitrary values that can vary along time under the inﬂuence of other
units (including itself), while also being able to implement local learning capabilities.

In such a framework, a network is: distributed, i.e.

there is no central supervisor;
asynchronous, meaning there is no central clock; numerical, which means computations
are explicit and no symbols are used (as in algebra); and adaptive, so something may be
learned. In the version used in this work, however, synchronous approximation is used as
results are similar when properly considering the time-related variables of the diﬀerential
equations [165][134].

As shown in the previous chapter (cf. section 1.7), several diﬀerent time variables are
part of the system here studied. Not only the diﬀerent timings in transmission, but also in
processing must be considered. Fortunately, as one uses diﬀerential equations in DANA,
here the main task is creating proper equations that will represent asynchronous results,
when the actual computations are synchronous. To do this, two parameters are to be
carefully tuned in the diﬀerential equations [165][134]: the time constant τ , linked directly
to the neural timing (e.g. 100ms for changing in burst/tonic modes, cf. section 1.4.1), and
the integration time step ∆t (e.g. 10ms to be small enough to consider real spiking times,
even when working with rates; cf. section 2.1.1). These time variables are considered as
constants. Other constant time variables are the diﬀerent latencies, which are included
either as delays outside, or time constants inside the equations. The choice of having both
options is only made for readability of the equations, as they can be included directly inside
the processing mechanism of each structure.

Our system targets natural image scenarios, where it will explore the scene and, de-
pending on the results from the diﬀerent evaluations, will change its attentional focus.
A natural image, or an image from a natural scene, has a statistical structure the visual
system is adapted to [76]. For example, if some dangerous stimulus is present, while other
“normal” stimuli are there as well, it will focus its attention on the dangerous one. The
input to the system is the visual stimuli presented to the retina, and transformed into an
activation map. In this work, sequences (of natural images) are used. Sometimes these
“natural” images contain “not-so-natural” stimuli, like man-made objects, that have not
had the time to be included in our pre-wired streams, considering evolution. Despite this
fact, and just for illustrative purposes, one can train a non-standard stream to be atten-
tive to man-made objects. When working with natural images in a computational model,
one core decision is whether we want our model to be biologically plausible, this meaning

63

Chapter 2. Bio-inspired dynamical systems and algorithms

that the algorithms should respect and predict results measured from biological systems of
the studied type or structure. In order to work with these images, we will use the CImg
library3. Re-using the work of [168], we have written a Python wrapper to extend not only
the additions to the CImg library, but the library itself.

Once ﬁnished, one would like to measure the performances of the simulation. To this
end, the easiest test is to check whether the focus corresponds to a relevant target, which
corresponds to a qualitative analysis, and could be easily done by an external observer.
This can be done either qualitatively, where an external observer could say that the results
seem good, for instance; or quantitatively, where a numerical value will determine the
“goodness” of the model. Moreover, a sometimes hidden aspect is how well a simulation
responds to variations of its parameters, where the quantitative analysis is essential.

In order to quantify the performances, one can instead consider –for simplicity– a fake
focus point, where a subject would (more or less) focus, and compute the (euclidean)
distance between the subject focus and the simulation given point. Of course this analysis
would be more realistic if an actual device would measure the focus of a subject, or the
average focus of many subjects, but for the sake of simplicity the previous approach has
been used in this work.

Conclusion

2.3

When developing a minimal model, the main idea is not only to reduce complexity to a
level easy to handle, implement, and explain, but also to guaranty both minimal complexity
and falsiﬁability of the model. By minimal complexity, we mean that to reproduce a given
behavior, we have chosen non superﬂuous mechanisms, so that the model is not going
to predict spurious results. By falsiﬁability, we mean that the model does not predict
everything, thus anything, but take the risk to bet some new unpredictable phenomenon.
In our case, the complexity of the early visual system is ﬁrst distributed among the
diﬀerent structures, generating modules where local computations are carried out. The idea
of distributed complexity arises from complex, emergent, behaviors: we implement local

computations, and through the diﬀerent interactions, structures and loops, the complex
computations are possible. For each structure, we consider its known anatomical inputs
(cf. Chapter 1), where if their role is not fully known, we hypothesize on how they could
work inside the local computation.

Each local computation is itself a simpliﬁcation from the “full mechanism”. Our local
computations are either taken from the literature, or based on it and reduced. For instance,
we reuse algorithms for standard retinal cells, while the mismatch mechanism for TRN is
based in work such as that of [67]. In short, the idea is to keep the model as linear as
possible, minimizing the amount of non-linearities, where computations can be expressed
as spatio-temporal convolutions, where the temporal ones are ﬁrst-order as they can be
represented by delays.

Apart the straightforward combination of drivers and modulators (cf. section 2.1.2),
the cortical column (cf. section 1.3) is reduced to a dynamical neural ﬁeld (cf. section
2.1.5), which represents the behavior of the column in a simpliﬁed way.

Among the restrictions, one should also take into account the fact that the resolution
of our system is homogeneous, i.e., not making a serious distinction of density of certain
neurons in central and peripheral regions. Also, binocularity is not directly considered, as
we work with one information ﬂow.

As for the diﬀerent parameters of this model, we have chosen them by hand, and test

the ensemble while testing the individual modules. We could have also done a systematic
research (e.g. [8]) to tune the parameters, but we have opted for an a posteriori validation.

Summary

The previous chapters have given the bases to understand this work. In this chapter,
we present the diﬀerent modules of our model, while in the next chapter, numerical results
will be presented.

Each module carries out a local computation, and corresponds to a well-identiﬁed brain
structure. Here, indeed, global emergent properties are not hard-built, but eventually
appear as a result of the interactions between the diﬀerent modules.

The main goal with these modules is to capture the essentials properties stated in
the literature, regarding input/output processing. As simple as we can without losing
performance and generality, as discussed in the previous chapter.

Implementation, Early visual system, Dynamics, Architecture

Organization of this chapter:

We start with a brief summary of the key points previously discussed in terms of archi-

tecture and dynamics, to then discuss each module in detail.

For each module, we give its functional description and the expected algorithmic logic
of its processing, where more developed functions emerge from its interactions with other
modules.

Summary of previous sections

3.1

In order to point out the essential points of the previous two chapters, we here provide
a short summary, before proceeding with the description of the implementation of the work
proposed in this thesis.

Each section contains also speciﬁc reminders for each structure.

3.1.1 Architecture of the system

It must ﬁrstly be reminded that three visual pathways are elaborated from the mammalian
retinal circuitry [107]. In addition to the Parvocellular visual pathway (mainly involved in
contrast perception) and the Magnocellular pathway (mainly involved in motion percep-
tion) –respectively feeding the ventral for perception and the dorsal for action cortical axes
[115]–, the Koniocellular pathway performs non-standard visual processing [107] (mainly
involved in detection), with a variety of responses corresponding to a global analysis of
color or motion distribution in the visual ﬁeld for the detection of biologically signiﬁcant
patterns (e.g.
looming or approach-like pattern of a predator, highly periodic patterns
corresponding to snake movements [78]). This is in fact an ancient visual pathway, inher-
ited from amphibians where the visual system is mainly limited to the retina extracting
this kind of basic information (preys and predators detection) and directly activating the
tectum, a visuo-motor structure responsible for orientation and action (ﬂeeing or catch-
ing). Such a primitive analysis has probably some advantages, since it was kept along
phylogeny and even described as complexiﬁed in primates [70][78]. As in amphibians, the
Koniocellular pathway is still directly connected to a sensorimotor structure, responsible of
orientation (and saccades), called the Superior Colliculus (SC) in mammals [102]. A part
of the Magnocellular pathway also reaches the SC (in a distinct visual layer, [102]) and
both Konio and Magno ﬂows are then sent back to the thalamus (resp LGN and Pulvinar
[102]). The visual layers of the SC also receive more elaborated visual information from a
variety of cortical areas, that might also ultimately activate deep motor layers of the SC for
orientation (mostly by saccades) and consequently attention to the stimulus, whereas rapid
defensive reactions in case of emergency are also reported [41][43]. In that sense, the SC
can be seen both as a primitive sensorimotor structure receiving basic information about
the location (and not the identity) of loci of interest (threat, salient motion), triggering
automatic movement of orientation when the intensity of stimulation is strong enough;

69

Chapter 3. Implementing a non-standard early visual system

and as a more elaborated structure, like a saliency map, where various cerebral structures
accumulate their own preference on the next place to focus on, and compete for the actual
choice of the next saccade [41]. Additionally, [85] reports that, in the human, ultra-fast
saccades (120ms) towards images of animals exist, reinforcing this idea.

Of course, consistent with the development of cortical inﬂuence in higher mammals, the
diﬀerent information ﬂows also project directly in LGN toward the cortex, the three kinds
of cells being kept separate in speciﬁc geniculate layers [153] and forming the higher road,
as evoked above. Whereas the Parvo and Magno LGN layers project through (distinct
sublayers of) layer IV of V1 towards the ventral and dorsal cortical axes to recognize
objects and prepare actions for the visual stimuli, the Konio LGN layer has a modulatory
role on them, with a projection to layer I of V1 [82].

3.1.2 Dynamics of the system

The above mentioned projection of the Konio, Parvo and Magno pathways, respectively to
the upper (Konio) and middle cortical layers, is more generally described as a key feature
of thalamocortical connectivity, having a strong impact on the dynamics of this network.
Core regions of the thalamus send, locally, highly-ordered information to layer IV of the
cortex (as it is the case for the Magno and the Parvo thalamic layers), whereas matrix
regions (like the Konio thalamic layers) send a diﬀuse information to layer I of widespread
cortical regions [82]. The former thalamocortical input has been described as a driver input,
bringing the perceptive information to the cortex and the later as a modulator input with a
longer and more global inﬂuence [149]. Loops between thalamus and cortex are closed with
layer VI of the cortex sending back a modulation to the same core region of the thalamus
and layer V sending a driver output toward higher order thalamic regions and toward the
SC [82].

This reciprocal connectivity is an important ingredient to the thalamocortical dynam-
ics, with the involvement of the Thalamic Reticular Nucleus (TRN) that sets the main
synchronization modes by its inhibitory inﬂuence on the thalamus, triggered on the ba-
sis of the feedforward and feedback information exchanged between the thalamus and the
cortex and crossing TRN in a topographic way [110]. In coherent mode, the tonic activity
of thalamic relay cells lets the core region send its driving perceptive information to the
cortex, resulting in gamma oscillations. In case of attentional demand (due to the occur-
rence of an unexpected event or to a cortical demand), the TRN inhibits thalamic relay
cells (burst mode). As a result, the diﬀuse modulatory connectivity of the matrix cells will

70

Chapter 3. Implementing a non-standard early visual system

possibly propose a new pattern of activation in the cortex, setting the attention in another
region that will be subsequently more deeply analyzed in tonic mode [81].

Our model of the early visual system: modular view

3.2

The aforementioned architecture and dynamics set the bases for our computational
model, which is shown in Figure 3.1. Here we can observe the diﬀerent activation maps of
the included areas, how they connect with each other (architecture), and their temporal
dynamics from stimulus onset (dynamics). Computations are done locally, and systemic
properties emerge naturally, such as stability and synchronization, while no “conductor”
has been developed, showing once again that it is the system itself who provokes and allows
for these properties to appear.

In the ﬁgure, red arrows are part of the standard pathway, whereas blue lines are
part of the non-standard stream. Green arrows represent regulatory ﬂows from TRN
(inhibitory), and cortical feedback (excitatory), which are considered as modulatory, but
do not make part of the non-standard pathway. Here, driver ﬂows are drawn in solid lines,
while modulating ﬂows use dashed lines.

As a reminder (cf. Section 2.1.2), a driver ﬂow is a main information stream, allowing
the recipient structure to produce its output based on it (i.e. independently of the existence,
or not, of a modulator). It is the case of, e.g., the input from the core thalamus to the cortex.
On the other hand, a modulator information ﬂow is unable to trigger a response, solely, on
its recipient structure, but instead participates in the process by adjusting the response to
the driver stream, particularly to make it more eﬀective. In this case we can consider the
input from the matrix thalamus to the cortex, providing contextual information to bias
cortical treatment towards a more relevant, maybe unattended, stimulus.

Another reminder is recommended to understand the key regulating role of TRN, and
it is about the tonic and burst activation modes (cf. Section 1.4.1). In tonic mode, the core
and matrix thalamus send their information “as expected by the cortex”, which means that
there is no great diﬀerence between cortical and thalamic information, where this diﬀerence
is measured by TRN. However, if this diﬀerence is great enough, TRN will communicate
this situation to both core and matrix thalamus, making them switch from the tonic mode
to the burst mode, where feedforward information is partially blocked, either to allow for
exploration on the scene, or to force feedback information at the thalamic level to ﬁnish the
analysis of the current visual hypothesis, which we originally call “forced feedback”, and it

mechanism of the thalamic reticular nucleus [90] for the feedforward information to the
cortex. The input used is a sequence of images, and the output is the representation of the
deep collicular visual orientation response to such input. Here, each structure implements
a spatio-temporal non-linear ﬁlter, except the primitive cortical structure that serves as an
integrator, and the deep superior colliculus, where target selection is performed by dynamic
neural ﬁelds. Latencies at each level are displayed for reference, and are included in our
computations.

Chapter 3. Implementing a non-standard early visual system

follows the same idea as the cortical process shown in Figure 1.9, but at the thalamic level
and with this diﬀerent computation (cf. Section 3.2.2). Whether to explore or to force
feedback information will depend on the situation, and it will also be an emergent decision
from the system (cf. Section 3.2.2).

To understand this ﬁgure, and the model, we also need to explain the diﬀerent mixing
mechanisms. At the retinal level, mixing in the non-standard area represents an accu-
mulation of activation, which could be considered as looking at the ensemble of pre-wired
stimuli, and topographically adding them. This is an oversimpliﬁcation, as it could happen
that two diﬀerent pre-wired stimuli share a region (cf. Section 3.2.1). At the thalamic level
(matrix thalamus), mixing comes from the activation modes being topographic, and since
in burst mode we seek for another hypothesis (or, better said, inhibit the previous one)
there could be an extreme transition case where topographic information generated from
two (or more) pre-wired stimuli is communicated to the cortex, and thus we use the term
“mixed” for simplicity (cf. Section 3.2.2). This inhibition follows the idea of “attenua-
tion before semantic analysis” of the model of selective attention by [172], however this
experiments were carried out with auditory stimuli.

A ﬁnal explanation needed is for the alert mechanism. This mechanism communicates a
region where an important, critical, stimulus has been found, and thus should be prioritized,
either for immediate action (even subconscious, as a reﬂex) at the collicular level, or for
biased processing in the thalamocortical loops. The alert signal is generated at the non-
standard retina level, where certain stimuli are pre-wired in the Konio detectors, that will
generate a coarse estimation of the visual scene, which is nevertheless essential to properly
bias treatment in the early system (cf. Section 3.2.1).

We implement our model using the DANA framework [132] (cf. section 2.1.5).
In the next sections, all equations use the notations of Table 2.2.
Now, let us look in detail at each structure.

3.2.1 Retina: Standard and non-standard cells

The ﬁrst stage in the feedforward information ﬂow is the retina. Here, for the sake of
simplicity, we use well established and biologically funded retinal models present in the
literature.

The standard retina is represented by parasol and midget cells. Parasol cells transform
the image sequence into a sequence of local movement information with high resolution
(about 2◦), while midget cells transform the image sequence into a sequence of contrast

73

The non-standard retina detects visual events in the image sequence.

Its cells have
large ﬁelds, and thus provide low resolution responses (about 10◦). Additionally, we set
a threshold for pre-wired (cf. Section 2.2.2) stimuli, and generate a third retinal ﬂow.
If the pre-wired activation surpasses this threshold, the response will be considered as
critical, generating an alert for the system, meaning that the information triggering the
alert should be studied as soon as possible, as it represents a possible immediate danger.
If the information does not surpass this threshold, it means that the system is not really
sure of the existence of this stimulus, and thus does not trigger the alarm mechanism. This
mechanism follows the “event/emergency” viewpoint of works such as [41] and [43], where
this ﬂow is sent to the superior colliculus.

Thus, we have three retinal outputs: the standard output (midget and parasol, i.e.
Parvo and Magno); the non-standard, target speciﬁc output (each detector for a speciﬁc
target, e.g. predator, sexual partner, food); and the non-standard mixed target output.
They are respectively called l1, l2 and l3, where the index “alert” or “mix” is used for l3
to denote whether the ﬂat mixed information is used, or the alert signal. Here, the ﬂat
information is the accumulation of information, while the alert signal will trigger biased
processing in the rest of the system. This ﬂat information follows the idea that the infor-
mation is not precise in the superior colliculus, and thus the SC lacks details about the
identity of the target; while the alert topographically shows where the attention should be
prioritized.

We need to adapt our retinal inputs to the format of the rest of the model. To this

end, we apply a sigmoidal normalization of the form:

ux = 2 ∗

1

1 + e−4 ψ ux − 1

(3.1)

where ψ = 0.06. Also, we need to generate the alert signal for the non-standard retina.
For simplicity, we threshold the mixture of the non-standard information such that:

alertl3 = max(mixl3, ψ)

(3.2)

where mixl3 is deﬁned by Equation (3.21).

To account for the latencies in the retina, we include temporal convolutions of the form:

lx = γx × ux

(3.3)

74

Chapter 3. Implementing a non-standard early visual system

where

γx(t) def=

− t
τx

e

1
τx

(3.4)

and t is the time, and τx the time constant for γx –based on the latencies, with τ1p = 25ms
(parasol), τ1m = 45ms (midget), τ2 = τ3 = 45ms (bistratiﬁed)–, while ux represents the
computation without delay. This nomenclature for γx will be used for the rest of the
structures, in order to include their respective latencies.

The implementation here mentioned corresponds to that of [168], where a Python

wrapper was written to reuse it.

3.2.2 Thalamus

The thalamus regulates feedforward information, depending on internal (e.g. needs or cor-
tical feedback) or external (stimulus novelty) criteria [146]. Here, each local computation
is important, but most important is the synergistic eﬀect between the structures, which
generates such regulation mechanisms. This regulation considers both rough and precise
inﬂuxes arriving from the retina, where they are kept separate through the Konio, Parvo
and Magno pathways, respectively, and consists on switching or mixing. Switching refers to
the change between tonic and burst activation modes, which implies a diﬀerent local com-
putation mechanism: relaying feedforward information, or “forcing feedback”, i.e., forcing a
top-down hypothesis in the core thalamus and pseudo-“blockage” of the driver information
(cf. Section 3.2 and Figure 1.9). Mixing may refer to topographically generate a current
hypothesis in the matrix thalamus (read below), or simply to accumulate activations at a
certain structure, as it happens with the mixed non-standard ﬂow, that basically combines
the diﬀerent non-standard ﬂows in a ﬂattened version (cf. Section 3.2.1).

The core thalamus adapts the standard feedforward information ﬂow depending on
what the cortex is currently analyzing and on whether there is a mismatch (lack of cor-
respondence) between the feedforward (from the core to cortical layer IV) and feedback
(from cortical layer VI to core) information ﬂows. The mismatch is computed in TRN and
communicated to the core via the inhibitory connections.

On the other hand, the matrix part, sheltering the non-standard cells, signals the pres-
ence of an important stimulus in the scene, but also generates a modulating signal for the
cortex to bias its treatment towards the possible existence of this (maybe dangerous) stim-
ulus. In other words, by mixing the non-standard retinal output, the inhibition from the
thalamic reticular nucleus, and the event/emergency information [41][43] received from SC

75

Chapter 3. Implementing a non-standard early visual system

(layer 2a, cf. Section 3.2.4), the matrix thalamus generates a sort of “current hypothesis”,
that takes into account the alert information, to modulate cortical processing.

The computation carried out by the core thalamus writes

l8 = γ8 × u8

where the spaces are just included to show which parts are comprised within the parts of
the equation, besides the diﬀerentiation for the cases. For instance, for each alert case, m8
is present, and l1 is considered in the tonic computation.

The current values were hand-tuned without looking for optimality (cf. Section 4.2.2),
and are present in Table 3.1. Here, L is an edge-detect-like kernel because information
corresponds to diﬀerential motion, and thus such kernel allows to emphasize higher values
inside the map while removing lesser variations of motion (thus making information ﬁner).

This means that if TRN sets the core thalamus in tonic mode, normal (driver, mod-
ulation and inhibition) interaction takes place, where the excitatory alert connection will
increment the numerical values of the alert region, so as to notify the standard pathway
of the presence of an alert. Else, i.e.
if TRN sets the core thalamus in burst mode, a
linear combination of the feedforward and feedback ﬂows is considered, so as to allow for
a “forced feedback”. This occurs as the information transmitted in tonic mode is mainly
driving, whereas in burst mode the “gating” mechanism of the core thalamus passes to

76

Chapter 3. Implementing a non-standard early visual system

“blocking mode”, and the driving information becomes secondary, while feedback infor-
mation becomes primary. Also, in these circumstances, the core thalamus keeps notifying
about the presence of an alert.

where the spaces are just included to show which parts are comprised within the parts of
the equation, besides the diﬀerentiation for the cases. Here, sd = 0.01 is a threshold to
remove the delay eﬀect on the binary information, and

ct+1 ≡ (ct + 1) mod C

((3.8)bis)

where C is the set of pre-wired stimuli in l2, and ct is the particular pre-wired stimuli
currently considered. Equation (3.8) means that in alert mode, the values are computed
so as to inform the rest of the system (also via this pathway, by a linear combination of
ﬂows) of the presence of the alert (so it may be analyzed promptly if needed). Equation
((3.8)bis) simply states that the system follows on the next pre-wired stimulus in modulo
integer. This is an oversimpliﬁcation since we expect the system to select the most “salient”
pre-wired stimulus, but it does not aﬀect the behavior we study here, and it is a trivial
extension of our present work.

Thalamic reticular nucleus

The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) regulates the feedforward information from the tha-
lamus to the cortex [90]. We implement it by computing the mismatch (or lack of synchro-
nization) between the feedforward and feedback information ﬂows, and communicating it
to the thalamus via inhibitory ﬂows. The mismatch is here deﬁned as the absolute variation
between thalamic and cortical core information. If this variation exists and is weak, it will
generate a mild inhibition, while if the variation exists and is strong enough, it will not

77

Chapter 3. Implementing a non-standard early visual system

only inhibit, but also trigger a burst, allowing the thalamus to generate a new hypothesis
(cf. Section 1.4).

Here, we should explain the thalamic “forced-feedback”, and the role of TRN regarding
this mechanism. The idea of “forced feedback” is similar to the one of Figure 1.9. Here,
information is forced into a unit in order to analyze a current hypothesis. Similar to the
one generated in the matrix thalamus from non-standard retinal information, the core
thalamus can be inhibited by TRN to prioritize a non-winning (because of the DNF, cf.
Section 2.1.5) information at the cortical level, while this can also happen globally to focus
the cortical analysis in a particular area. Eventually, with the inclusion of higher-cortical
areas, TRN will carry out the inhibition shown in Figure 1.9.

The computation carried out by TRN may be described by

values were hand-tuned without looking for optimality, and are present in Table 3.2.

3.2.3 Primary visual cortex

Here, the (primitive) visual cortex represents a single gathering structure. This means it
is not separated in the six classical layers, but instead it gathers all their functions in a
dynamic neural ﬁeld (DNF) [133][135]. As the main function is to analyze the current
hypothesis and to communicate the modulated standard information to the superior col-
liculus, TRN and the core thalamus, so as to complement the processing of the system
via more developed information, a DNF is simple and complex enough for the tasks here
studied. Since there are no higher-order cortical areas, and thus their feedback ﬂows, the
cortical mixture between Parvo and Magno ﬂows is not considered at this level. However,
one could directly implement an ad-hoc computation to account for this treatment, which
would only require modifying the cortex module.

The computation carried out by the cortex writes

with

and

3.2.4 Superior colliculus

As for the superior colliculus, we consider layers 2a and 2b of the superﬁcial superior
colliculus (sSC), and the deep superior colliculus (dSC).

The layer 2a of the superﬁcial superior colliculus (sSC-2a) is the gathering point for early
(non-standard retinal) information about targets with later (cortical) information of the

current treatment. Its output serves as the modulating information for the deeper superior
colliculus (via l6), while also being a relay of emergency information and an adapter of
event information [41][43] for the Thalamus (via both l12 and l13).

Also, l12 and l13 are the alert information for the core and matrix thalamus, respectively.
In our case, they are simple relays of the retinal alert information, though we are aware
that such signal should also consider cortical information in an extended model. Thus, we
write

l12 = l13 = alertl3

while a more elaborated equation might be considered.

The layer 2b of the superﬁcial superior colliculus (sSC-2b) is the converging point for
early (retinal) and later (cortical) Magno-like (standard) information. Retinal Parvo-like
information (from midget cells) does not reach the superior colliculus directly. Its output
is the driver information for the dSC. Its main function is to integrate the early and late
information for computing the saccadic output afterwards in the dSC.

The computation carried out by sSC-2b thus writes

The deep superior colliculus is in charge of computing the saccadic output –via a DNF–
and deploying the motor resources linked to this saccade (not-implemented as we are not
yet working with hardware). We consider the saccadic output to be a set of coordinates,
for the moment, basically to guide the attentional focus towards it. Eventually, when being
able to have a mobile system (e.g. a robot) depending on the classiﬁcation of the detected
and analyzed stimulus, the output will also indicate whether to approach or to escape.

3.2.5 Summary

Here, we have described the implementation of the local computations to be used in our
simulations. It is from this local computations that complex functions will emerge, and
this will be shown in the next chapter.

The computations we propose are biologically plausible, in term of structure and func-
tional properties. Here, we reuse other scientiﬁc work for the standard (Magno and Parvo)
pathways, while the novelty of this work is the inclusion of the non-standard (Konio)
pathway: its interactions with the Magno and to some extents Parvo pathways, and how
connections with the thalamus leads to interesting computational properties.

With respect to works like [124] or [67], we propose a minimal modeling as developed
in the previous chapter (less parameters, minimal computational operator). We however,
will not only test the result on a toy data set, but on real and realistic natural images, thus
allowing to obtain simulation results at the behavioral level.

82

Chapter 3. Implementing a non-standard early visual system

These behavioral results, will correspond to attentional shift in the deep superior col-
liculus, as a result of the diﬀerent interactions and processing of the diﬀerent pathways.
They thus correspond to the emerging algorithmic mechanisms discussed in this chapter.
More precisely, simulations correspond to stimuli where there is at least one distractor,
while the attentional focus should be directed towards the “critical stimulus”.

During these numerical experimentation, tuning is restricted to adapt the model to
its environment class (e.g. either artiﬁcial or natural images) or a change in the system
architecture (e.g. when adding the Parvo pathway in the loop), but no more.

Let us analyze the diﬀerent simulations in the next chapter.

Summary

The diﬀerent modules explained in the previous chapter are used to build diﬀerent mod-
els of the early visual system. As previously discussed, diﬀerent properties will emerge from
their union: not because they have been modeled so, but because of the self-arrangement
and organization of these modules and their treatment.
It is now time to observe this
experimentally.

In a nutshell: The models replicate the expected behavior of the attentional shifts tasks
in presence of “critical” (fearful) stimuli (cf. Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3). This is thanks to the
diﬀerent distributed local mechanisms, and the global mechanism, emergent. In addition,
the results show numerical robustness and stability.

We ﬁrst test the system with Magno and Konio sub-system, in a paradigm where
artiﬁcial stimuli are used. A sequence of full-contrast, noiseless images is created, and fed
to the model. The simulations allow us to tune the system and experiment that only a
relatively large modiﬁcations of the key parameters aﬀect the overall processing. Using a
fully controlled situation yields a quantitative analysis of these aspects.

The main goal of the numerical experimentation was to use natural images, and the
three (Magno, Parvo and Konio) systems. To this end, the second simulations were carried
out with natural images, ﬁrst with the same Magno+Konio model. Before including the
Parvo pathway, a battery of numerical tests was performed, to ensure numerical robustness,
stability and parameter sensitivity.

Finally, we show how our model is extended to include the Parvo pathway, reusing most
of the algorithms, and only applying a slight tuning to a few parameters for this change of
architecture. Similar stable, robust and eﬃcient results.

Keywords: Model, Result, Artiﬁcial image, Natural image, Robustness

Organization of this chapter:

This chapter starts with a brief introduction to the experimental process. First, results
obtained with very simple artiﬁcial stimuli are shown. These consist on the very ﬁrst
approach to a visual system, where the interactions between Magno and Konio pathways
are studied, together with giving a ﬁrst view at the numerical robustness the model oﬀers.
Then, natural images are used in the following experiments, where the ﬁrst one stays with
the Magno and Konio system, whereas the second one includes the Parvo pathway. Here,

85

Chapter 4. Our minimal model in the real world: Experimental results

an in-depth numerical robustness study is undertaken for the Magno and Konio system,
where the stability and robustness properties are kept. Then, when the Parvo pathway is
added, the system reuses many algorithms and works as expected. To end this chapter,
information of the open-access software is given.

86

Chapter 4. Our minimal model in the real world: Experimental results

Our contribution is to numerically experiment with a computational systemic model of
the primitive early visual system, including the non-standard (Konio) stream. This model
implements a coordinating thalamus, which allows to inﬂuence cortical processing with
contextual information of a fearful stimulus, if detected. This detection and bias towards
the fearful stimulus has to modify the response from the superior colliculus, making it
faster (as this “critical” stimulus will be prioritized). Here, we also include the simulation
of biological mechanisms, such as the burst and tonic activation modes for thalamocortical
communications, or the driver and modulator information ﬂows duality.

This model, shown in Figure 3.1, is formed by local computations (i.e. modular) and
thanks to the synergy between its components, we observe emergent behaviors, such as
stability or synchronization. It is also a reduced model, with few parameters, and easily
modiﬁable. Thanks to this, it is experimentally robust, while showing genericity in the
computation.

Other experiments have been conducted, but not presented here as results are similar
and do not modify the illustrations. They are available as supplementary material (cf. Sec-
tion 6), allowing to see that we not only show the “best” results but that these illustrative
results are reproducible.

The principles used in these diﬀerent protocols have been presented in Chapter 2, and

the implementation described in Chapter 3.

The goal of this chapter is to verify the expected behavior of the system in diﬀerent
scenarios, while analyzing the inner mechanisms and interplay between the diﬀerent sub-
modules.

First experimental result: using artiﬁcial images

4.1

In order to test the ﬁrst version of our work, we sought to use really simple stimuli, for
which the results could be easily predicted. We start with a version of only the Magno and
Konio systems.

Here, we use the video of two circular stimuli with diﬀerent sizes and speed, as shown
in Figure 4.1. The larger circle will, in this case, be considered as the fearful stimulus.
Here, the smaller circle can be considered as any neutral stimulus, in the sense that its
detection is not wired in the Konio pathway, and would not trigger any behavior higher in
the hierarchy.

The task is to detect and follow the fearful (pre-wired) stimulus. In the ﬁrst part, only

Chapter 4. Our minimal model in the real world: Experimental results

Figure 4.1: Sample of artiﬁcial stimuli used. First, a single target advances rightwards
(left) when, suddenly, a second, larger target, appears moving downwards at a slower speed
(right). The detection of this second stimulus is pre-wired in the Konio system and should
thus trigger a faster response. The arrows are not part of the stimulus. They are added so
as to understand the diﬀerent movements, where the longer yellow arrow means horizontal
movement, quicker the blue vertical arrow.

one neutral stimulus is present, without noise nor distractors, thus the system will easily
detect and follow this stimulus. However, when a fearful, but slower, stimulus, moving in
a perpendicular direction (as vertical opposed to horizontal) appears, rather than keeping
the attentional focus on the faster stimulus, thanks to the modulation and alert of the non-
standard system, the attentional focus will switch towards the slower –fearful– stimulus.

Our results in this detection, selection and tracking task (attentional shift) follow the
prediction that by the inclusion of the Konio pathway, these actions are done faster than
with a purely Magno system, when the existence of the fearful stimulus is acquainted for in
the non-standard information ﬂows. We also test the numerical robustness of the model, as
another objective of this work is to develop a stable model without many parameters. We
realize that variations of up to +100% lead mainly to violate bio-plausibility, rather than
to provoke numerical instability. In addition, when doubling (K) the DNF simply stays
ﬁxed in a point, but numerical instability was not found. We remind that no saturation
mechanism is applied at the output of any structure (cf. Section 2.2.4), and thus that
avoiding numerical instability is an emergent property of the system.

88

Chapter 4. Our minimal model in the real world: Experimental results

4.1.1 Discrimination, selection and tracking

To draft a comparison between the simulation results, and the expected results, we propose
two indicators:

• The distance between the center of mass of the stimulus supposed to be attended
and the center of the obtained response in dSC, which we denote “d”. The location
of the “supposed to be attended” stimulus is artiﬁcially generated by hand, as we
create the stimuli and its shape allows to need just a simple computation to obtain
it. These results are shown in Figure 4.2.

• The percentage error between surfaces of the dSC generated image (from the obtained
response) and the retinal image, which we denote “Se”. These results are shown in
Figure 4.3.

The relatively better performance of the purely Magno system in the beginning of the
simulation is explained as the activation levels are smaller –absence of Konio modulation
as fearful stimulus is not present– and thus the DNF may follow more quickly. However,
in the second part, i.e. when the pre-wired stimulus appears, the Magno+Konio system
quickly overtakes in performances and converges in a quicker manner, with a better ongoing
pursuit.

4.1.2 Numerical Robustness

One of the goals of this work is to develop a minimal simple model. The values chosen
for the parameters are hand picked and are based on other studies (e.g. delays based on
latencies) or biologically plausible numerical needs (e.g. a small threshold as a minimal
amount of activation needed for a unit to respond). One of our goals is to provide a
numerically robust model. Here, we test for positive diﬀerences of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and
100% of the values of: (i) a9, the cortical matrix gain, as one of the interesting points
in this study is the inﬂuence of the Konio pathway on standard information processing
(Figure 4.4); (ii) g9, the cortical input gain, as we state that the coarse interpretation done
by the colliculus with retinal information will be later reinforced by this “more developed”
(in terms of detail) information ﬂow (Figure 4.5); (iii) K, the amplitude of the diﬀerence
of Gaussians used for the DNFs, as it is these DNFs that will allow to detect, select and
track the most salient stimulus in the visual scene, and this parameter regulates the local
feedback of the DNFs (Figure 4.6). Specially, it is the only case where variations over

Figure 4.2: Simulation results: Euclidean distance of center of mass of attended
stimulus to center of the dSC generated image (from the obtained response), in
arbitrary units. While for the small stimulus a purely Magno system tracks slightly better
the target, when the large stimulus appears (t=5s) it is the mixed system that fairly quickly
shows a better tracking response. The peak is because we manually set the reference point
at the “predator target” when it appears, thus because of the geometrical location of the
attentional focus, the distance to the “correct” target becomes suddenly big.

stable; (iv) τ11, the time constant of the dSC, as it is here that the decision should be
made, whether to follow or to ﬂee in the case of a predator [19] (Figure 4.7).

by varying the cortical matrix gain in 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100%. As a9 increases,
the system takes longer to converge. A more notorious diﬀerence is made after a +20%
increment.

These results show that, in an artiﬁcial scenario, the responses of the system are sim-
ilar to what is expected, while at the same time being robust enough to changes in its
parameters.

While the sequence has only one stimulus, the attentional focus is following it, and when
the fearful stimulus comes into scene, the attentional focus switches towards it because of
the action of the non-standard pathway. This provides a good ﬁrst result to move towards
natural images. The performance of the system is lowered after relatively big modiﬁcations
(e.g. +50% of g9), and this is a good starting point for the re-usability of the modules with
natural images, and eventually the Parvo pathway.

allow for correct tracking. With a +50% variation the system does not change attention
to the stimulus under alert, and with +100% variation the DNF simply stays ﬁxated at
a point, and as the small stimulus continues its path the distance increases, while when
the second stimulus arrives, as it approaches this ﬁxation point, the distance reduces itself
gradually (both increase and decrease proportional to the speed of the stimulus that should
be attended).

Original experimental result: using natural images (M+K)

4.2

In order to extend the ﬁrst version of our work, we use natural stimuli, as our system
is particularly dedicated to these kinds of stimuli. An important characteristic of natural
images is the diﬃculty to work with them, as they are noisy, contain several stimuli at times
and may contain close distractors. They also have spectral characteristics that are very
diﬀerent from the previous artiﬁcial stimuli: instead of maximum contrast, the whole range
of contrasts is allowed; instead of stimuli with opposed movements (horizontal and vertical),
our sequences here use complex movements (including approaching motion), among others.
Because of these characteristics, the stimuli are pre-treated, ﬁltered and overall “adapted”
before being used as input for our model (cf. Chapter 2). We start with a version of
only the Magno and Konio systems, and we will include the Parvo pathway in the next
experiment.

95

Chapter 4. Our minimal model in the real world: Experimental results

Here, we use the video of a kitten approaching a camera1, as if to pounce on it, as shown
in Figure 4.8. The kitten will, from now on, be considered as the fearful stimulus. We

added a sliding text at a constant speed (faster than the kitten) to test the response of the
system in a scenario where, being a classically more salient stimulus present –sliding text
faster, and thus it would win the DNF competition if only the Magno stream were present–,
the Konio stream allows i) the thalamus to inﬂuence cortical processing with the fearful
contextual information, and ii) the superior colliculus to trigger an autonomic response (in

this case, focus of attention) faster than expected using solely retinal information.

Our results in a detection, selection and tracking task are qualitatively similar to those
of human observation (cf. Figure 4.9). We also test the numerical robustness of the model,
as another objective of this work is to develop a stable model without many parameters.
We realize that variations of up to +100% lead mainly to violate bio-plausibility, rather
than to provoke numerical instability. However, this property is challenged only by one
parameter when doubled (K). We remind that no upper thresholding/saturation is applied
at the output of any structure, precisely so avoiding numerical instability results as an
emergent property of the system.

4.2.1 Discrimination, selection and tracking

We qualitatively draft a comparison between the simulation estimations and the targets.
An overview of this process is shown in Figure 4.9. Here, we use a video with a fearful
stimulus (kitten) and a distractor (sliding text) as stimulus. The distractor has a constant,
faster speed than the fearful stimulus, and thus will attract the attention of a Magno-
only system, which is represented by the red marker. The fearful stimulus is on the hunt,
approaching smoothly and preparing to pounce on its target (the video camera), and
because of these irregular motion behaviors a Magno-only system, while the distractor is
present, will not be able, solely, to focus its attention on it. With the addition of the Konio
pathway (system represented by the green marker), we observe a change in attention,
which comes from the inﬂuence of the non-standard detection on the thalamic, cortical
and collicular areas. Moreover, with the addition of the alert mechanism to the Magno
and Konio system, this case represented by the blue marker, we observe a correct, or at
least faster, positioning of the attentional focus on the fearful stimulus. This is due to
several factors, and we can observe, also in Figure 4.9, their inﬂuence and importance to
the outcome.

The situation here is the following:

1. The standard system detects motion (cf. Figure 4.10)

2. The non-standard system detects the fearful stimulus, and the alert information is
sent towards SC (and relayed to LGN). Then, the cortex is biased towards the kitten,
rather than keeping its focus at the sliding text (distractor) (cf. Figure 4.11)

3. TRN computes the mismatch and inhibits the text and extra motion in the scene (so

(kitten) moves and stays still, and thus continuous competition is tested. The red marker
is the equivalent of the ﬁxation point for an only-Magno system, while the green marker
represents a system including the Konio pathway. The blue marker corresponds to a system
including also the alert mechanism.

the cortex focuses on the fearful stimulus) (cf. Figure 4.12)

4. Topographic tonic/burst information is sent to the cortex

5. Matrix, modulating information is processed by the cortex (cf. Figure 4.12)

6. Cortical output generates forced feedback if needed, and helps the decision at the SC

(cf. Figure 4.12)

In addition, this system can easily simulate any “lesions” by simply deactivating a connec-
tion. The maps shown in Figure 4.9 are obtained from the Magno+Konio+Alert system
(blue marker), and the other two markers are added for comparison. As shown, and thanks
to the combined action of the diﬀerent mechanisms and interactions mentioned, the system
including the alert mechanism responds more rapidly.

Figure 4.10: Retinal detection (standard). Here, the non-standard retina does not
clearly identify the fearful stimulus, and the system responds to the most salient movement,
coming from the sliding text.

To be able to compare the performances of the three systems we measured, for the
sliding text, the minimal distance to the line where it is moving; whereas for the kitten

Chapter 4. Our minimal model in the real world: Experimental results

Figure 4.11: Retinal detection (non-standard). This time, the non-standard retina
does identify the fearful stimulus, and thus communicates this information to the SC and
LGN, to bias posterior treatment towards this important target, here shown faster by the
cortex, but very tightly followed by the SC.

Chapter 4. Our minimal model in the real world: Experimental results

Figure 4.12: TRN and mismatch in action. When TRN checks for the mismatch
between feedforward and feedback information, while the system being modulated/biased
by the non-standard information, the sliding text must be inhibited to allow for proper
treatment of the fearful stimulus, and this is why we see it darker in the image (darker
means larger inhibition for this map).

101

Chapter 4. Our minimal model in the real world: Experimental results

we manually select the ﬁxation points at its head. We then measured the euclidean dis-
tance between the simulated estimation and the two targets, and plotted these values as
simulation errors, as shown in Figure 4.13, for the three studied systems, where the line
colors correspond to those of the markers of Figure 4.9. We can see in Figure 4.13 that,
despite being in a complex situation, the behavior of our system roughly corresponds to
an usual human observation, when considering attentional shifts. As a pure Magno early
visual system, its attention will focus on the fastest stimulus present in the scene, and we
can see this specially in Figure 4.13 (bottom), where the error is practically a low constant
value, because the text is faster at almost all times. However, when adding the Konio
system, and particularly with its alert mechanism, we observe that, thanks to the diﬀerent
interactions between pathways, the system is able to switch its attentional focus towards
the fearful stimulus (kitten), when it moves (i.e. when detected, as we consider only motion
information). This is all thanks to the addition of the non-standard pathway: the matrix
ﬂow to the cortex, regulated by TRN, will communicate modulating information of the
important stimulus, while the superﬁcial SC transmits the alert signal to the (core and
matrix) thalamus and the deep SC, so their processing is biased towards this “extremely
relevant stimuli”.

What happens is that when the “predator” is not moving, the DNF will only use the
environmental information from camera movements (i.e. noise) and its internal feedback,
but as the moving text is present, it switches its attention towards it. However, then
the predator moves, the system detects it and reacts: the standard pathway transmits
feedforward speciﬁc information, while the non-standard pathway transmits the alert and
modulatory information to the matrix thalamus and the superﬁcial superior colliculus.
Here, the SC is already able to trigger a reaction, while the cortex will quickly validate
its decision thanks to the action of the thalamocortical processing regulated by TRN:
the presence of the fearful stimulus is transmitted to the cortex, which will allow for the
predator to be prioritized, and the mismatch will allow TRN to inhibit other regions, such
as the distractor (sliding text) and environmental noise.

4.2.2 Numerical robustness

This minimal simple model uses hand-picked values for its parameters. These are based on
other studies (e.g. delays based in latencies) or biologically plausible numerical needs (e.g.
a small threshold as a minimal amount of activation needed for a unit to respond). Here,
we tested certain values for negative and positive diﬀerences of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100%.

Our minimal model in the real world: Experimental results

Only the case of K + 100% led to numerical instability after 16.29 simulated seconds, which
represents roughly 66% of the duration of the input video. To exemplify, Figure 4.14 shows
the variations for g9, Figure 4.15 shows the variations for Z, and Figure 4.16 shows the
variations for K.
In these ﬁgures we can observe certain improvements when modifying
parameters, but some of them are not biologically plausible, which is represented by the
dashed lines. These values usually mean an activation level of over 100% in a particular
structure (not necessarily the one where the modiﬁed variable is used). All these results,
and the results for the rest of the parameters of the system, are compiled in Table 4.1.

In Table 4.1, we observe again the numerical instability of K + 100%, two cases where
there would be no output –when g5 or g11 have zero value–, the case of complete input
annihilation if we nullify the rectiﬁcation parameter (provoking a constant input), and the
case of instantaneous eﬀect, which besides unrealistic, numerically would imply dividing
by zero in the diﬀerential equations.

Experimental result: using natural images (P+M+K)

4.3

In this experimental result, we add the Parvo pathway, and its contrast analysis capa-
bilities. Another video2 is used here to better illustrate how contrast information is used
within the early visual system. The real early visual system processes also color informa-
tion through this pathway, but as we build our models incrementally (adding one thing
at a time), at the current stage color is not used in our model. In this video, a blackish
dog receives a yellow tennis ball that has been thrown by an unseen thrower, while on the
background one can see grass, bushes and trees. In the beginning, one can only see the dog
moving, while after some time the ball, which will be considered as the fearful stimulus,
appears from the top of the image. The usage of the ball as fearful stimulus is an artiﬁcial
scenario, made up to illustrate the addition of the Parvo pathway. The Magno+Konio
system shown in the previous section is already capable of switching its attention focus to
the ball, but we wanted to see whether we could also use the Parvo pathway to help using
the contrast information.

In this illustration we also look at a detection, selection and tracking task. However,
there are four diﬀerences. One is the fact that the standard midget cells do not project to
the superior colliculus. The second one is the mixing done at the deep superior colliculus,
where at the time a simple average of the saliency maps has been done, and this result

retinal time constant)
are changed for the Parvo pathway. These numerical modiﬁcations are presented in Table
4.2, and the ensuing numerical analysis for robustness has not been considered as these
modiﬁcations are only reductive (“lowering” a value).

An overview of the results is shown in Figure 4.17, where the marker represents the

attentional focus at that stage.

Here, what happens is the following:

1. The parasol cells detect motion, while the midget cells do the contrast analysis (cf.

Figure 4.18)

2. The ball (fearful stimulus) appears, and while the Magno system detects it (and is
already modifying its focus), the Parvo system takes longer to do this (cf. Figure
4.19)

3. When the Parvo system ﬁnishes switching the focus, the Magno system seems to still
hesitate between stimuli. This could be because of the similar speeds at that instant,
and the internal connection of the DNF used (cf. Figure 4.20)

4. Both systems converge at the fearful stimulus after some more time passes (cf. Figure

4.21)

In addition to the previous results, the system has been simulated with a lesion on
the connection between parasol and Magno cells. The parasol projections to the superior
colliculus have been left intact. This is done to show with more detail the importance of the
Parvo pathway, and how the Parvo+Konio interactions would allow for a proper attentional

Figure 4.17: Overview of results with natural stimuli in the P+M+K system.
Here, the pre-wired target (ball) appears after the dog starts moving. The markers are
equivalent to the ﬁxation point for the systems. The blue marker represents a normal sys-
tem, i.e., a system composed of all three pathways in a healthy situation. The red marker,
however, presents a lesion between the retina and LGN, where the parasol cells cannot
communicate to the Magno cells, thus depriving LGN and cortex of motion information.
This system already includes the alert mechanism, and the simulation images correspond
to the unhealthy system with the healthy marker added from the same point of time in
the healthy simulation. Here, the conclusion can be seen in the upper left ﬁgure, where
the blue marker is closer to the fearful stimulus than the unhealthy one. Also, we observe
that the healthy system changes much faster (not shown here), and we infer this is due to
the action of the Magno-like system, which is able to process information faster than the
Parvo-like system, and thus will help deciding and reacting in a shorter amount of time.

Figure 4.20: Focus switch occurs. After little time, both systems change their focus
towards the fearful stimulus. Here, the Parvo system seems to be more accurate than the
Magno system, despite the latter changing faster. This sort of “hesitation” from the Magno
system could be because of the internal connection of the corresponding DNF, together
with the similar motion obtained from the distractor.

Figure 4.21: Parvo and Magno convergence. After some time, both systems are
focused at the fearful stimulus, and this is possible thanks to the action of the Konio system.
Notice that in this frame the non-standard retina does not show the fearful stimulus, and
this could be because of how the stimulus was learned: isolated, not in the snout of a dog.

shift; similar to what was done with the M+K system. Also, this simulation allows to pay
more attention at the way of working of the Parvo pathway. No other parameters (than
the lesion) have been changed from the previous simulation. The lesion on the midget cells
is equivalent to presenting other example of the M+K system shown previously, so it has
been omitted.

Here –and using the same time points as for the previous simulation–, what happens is

the following:

1. The parasol cells detect motion, while the midget cells do the contrast analysis. No-
tice that since the lesion is for the parasol output towards Magno cells (no data
neither in the thalamus, nor in the cortex), the SC still receives the motion informa-
tion, which allows the focus to be at the dog (cf. Figure 4.22)

2. The ball (fearful stimulus) appears, and this is already visible in the Parvo-like cortex,

which starts changing its focus (cf. Figure 4.23)

3. When the Parvo system ﬁnishes switching the focus, this information is communi-
cated to the SC. Here, the collicular DNF still does not change its focus (cf. Figure
4.24)

4. The system converges at the fearful stimulus after some more time passes (cf. Figure

4.25)

The performance of the system is measured by simply comparing its attentional focus to
a man-made focus at the ball, the fearful stimulus. The results, though still illustrative, are
shown in Figure 4.26. Here, we see that the system converges, despite the diﬀerent timings
for the driving pathways, and the Magno and Parvo pathways working independently only
till the deep superior colliculus. This is thanks to the action of the Konio pathway, the
regulation from TRN, and the diﬀerent interactions throughout the whole system, for both
the healthy system and the unhealthy one. We notice, however, the diﬀerence in speed
between them, where the healthy one (containing the standard feedforward Magno-like
information) performs better than its unhealthy counterpart.

We thus illustrate how to reuse the thalamocortical computations (modules) proposed
for the Magno pathway, now for the Parvo pathway. The system is easily modiﬁed to include
another pathway, keeping its properties when already stable parameters are lowered. In
addition, we can easily study certain failures inside the system, where diminished or nulliﬁed
connections is only a single example of the full potential of this model.

in Figure 4.18, the parasol cells detect motion coming from the dog, while the midget

diﬀerence is the lesion in the link between parasol and Magno cells, where the Magno-
related collicular links are responsible for the selection of the dog.

Figure 4.23: Appearance of the fearful stimulus. After some time, the fearful stimulus
(tennis ball) appears, and despite noticing this in the cortical map, the Parvo-like cortical
DNF has only started switching the focus. This is already a proof of the slower processing,
when compared to the Magno system, as we use the same time points as in the previous
simulation.

Figure 4.24: Focus switch occurs cortically, but it is not yet reﬂected collicularly.
After little time, the Parvo system changes its focus towards the fearful stimulus. However,
this has just happened cortically, while the colliculus stays at the dog position. This follows
the fact of slower Parvo treatment when compared to Magno treatment.

Figure 4.26: Simulation results for the P+M+K systems. As for the M+K system,
the error is computed as the euclidean distance to target, where the reference point has
been built by hand. For simplicity, as this is only an illustration, only the full system
has been analyzed in both healthy and unhealthy –broken connection between parasol and
Magno cells– cases. The lower error to both targets is explained because the distractor is
approaching towards the fearful stimulus (dog catching the tennis ball). We notice that
the green curve (unhealthy system) reacts slower when compared to the blue one, and we
infer this is because of the lack of the standard Magno-like information towards LGN, the
cortex and ultimately the SC, because of the disability in the parasol-Magno connection.

About observed emerging properties

4.4

“The strategy, as we have said, is to build a cognitive system, not from symbols and
rules, but from simple components that can be dynamically linked between each other in
a very dense manner. Here, each component works in its local environment so as that
the system cannot be operated by an external agent that would pull the lever, in a sort
of way. But thanks to the nature of the conﬁguration of the system, a global cooperation
emerges spontaneously when the states of each concerned neuron yield a satisfactory global
performance. Such a system does not require a central processing unit to control its
operation. This transfer of local rules to the global coherence is the heart of what was
agreed to be called self-organization during the years of cybernetics. Today, one prefers to
talk about emerging or global properties, of dynamical networks, or nonlinear, of complex
systems, or even of synergy.” (Translated to English from [178]).

The previous paragraph encompasses the spirit of our systemic approach and its prop-

erties.

Furthermore, our simulation allows us to make two predictions about some neural

properties of the system:

• On the one hand, the adaptation following target selection in the thalamocortical
loop, involves the inhibition by TRN, independently of the existence of an alert

• On the other hand, the numerical stability in the range of bio-plausible values, makes

us predict that no saturation mechanisms are in action

These are not the only possible predictions but we propose to make them explicit and

make the bet that they are veriﬁed experimentally.

Conclusion

“Great is the art of beginning, but greater is the art of ending”
– Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

This study was set up to explore the role of the thalamus and the non-standard visual
pathway in the behavioral responses of the early visual system. This work also sought
to develop a computational model to test our hypotheses using simulations of real-world
scenarios, with natural image sequences. The general theoretical and experimental litera-
ture on this subject explores the roles and interactions between the so-called “standard”
visual pathways: Parvocellular and Magnocellular, with a particular emphasis on what
happens in the brain. Our study reuses the core ideas of this literature, together with
newer sources regarding non-standard visual streams. We consider the early visual system
and its processing, in order to answer the questions:

1. How does this non-standard visual system aid behavioral processes, more speciﬁcally

visual event detection?

2. How do these standard and non-standard information ﬂows interact in the early visual

system?

3. What is the role of the thalamus in the regulation and synchronization of the diﬀerent

feed-forward and feedback information ﬂows?

4. Can one put all this into a piece of software and use it for simulations, and eventually

for applications beyond brain understanding?

118

Chapter 5. Our minimal model in the real world: Experimental results

The main ﬁndings of this study are shown and discussed in Chapter 4: Our minimal
model in the real world: Experimental results. This section synthesizes these ﬁndings to
make explicit the answer we can oﬀer regarding the four issues proposed here.

1. How does this non-standard visual system aid behavioral processes, more speciﬁcally

visual event detection?

Through the coarse detection mechanisms present in the non-standard ganglion cells,
its output is able to communicate, via a direct connection, to the superior collicu-
lus, allowing rapid event/emergency behavior. The non-standard visual system thus
allows the superior colliculus to initiate an action without the need for cortical pro-
cessing.

Furthermore, the modulation imposed by the Konio cells to the cortex aﬀerences –in
both Parvo and Magno information ﬂows–, biases the response towards the detected
visual event. However, this bootstrapping information, fast but coarse when not spu-
rious, is regulated by the cortex to prevent a critical response to a “ghost” stimulus,
i.e. a stimulus not really present in the scene.

2. How do these standard and non-standard information ﬂows interact in the early visual

system?

Even if these streams travel in parallel along most of the early visual system, they do
not interact at each step. On the contrary, clear interactions between them exist at
the primary visual cortex, and the superior colliculus, as implemented in our model.

In V1, both standard information ﬂows (Parvo and Magno) are separately modulated
In the SC, not only cortical and retinal
by the non-standard (Konio) pathway.
information are meshed. Both standard pathways are mixed, and ultimately the
dSC computes the ﬁnal behavioral decision.

3. What is the role of the thalamus in the regulation and synchronization of the diﬀerent

feed-forward and feedback information ﬂows?

The thalamus is at a ﬁrst glance a smart “relay” for the retinal information to the
cortex, when working in the tonic mode. It is a smart relay because its core part
also processes this information, while non-standard collicular information and cortical
feedback are taken into account. This feedback inﬂuences the core treatment both
directly and through TRN.

119

Chapter 5. Our minimal model in the real world: Experimental results

The matrix part of the thalamus is also regulated by TRN (who serves as the thalamic
regulator at all levels), but seems to lack a cortical connection. Though this last
statement is sometimes contradicted in the literature, we have opted for the classical
approach.

The TRN regulates the thalamus, and thus all three information ﬂows, through se-
lective inhibition. This inhibition is the result of the thalamocortical mismatch:
feedforward thalamic versus cortical feedback ﬂows. The result of this mismatch
helps switching into the burst mode (or back to the tonic mode), and to regulate
what information should pass, or simply how much of it, as it can be fully inhib-
ited, partially inhibited, or not inhibited. This inhibition is topographic (one to one
mapping on the retinotopic map).

4. Can one put all this into a piece of software and use it for simulations, and eventually

for applications beyond brain understanding?

Yes, and possibly yes. We present in this work a computational model where we have
studied our hypotheses and reused the main ideas present in the literature, where we
can easily study lesions too, and with relatively simple algorithms that could be used
in simple, and eventually more developed, robots.

For prosthetics, we have shed some light on the “why/what-for” the retinal informa-
tion is used. The main message here is that a complete artiﬁcial retina can by no
mean be “a camera connected to the thalamus”, whereas it must include visual pre-
processing at the edge of the state of the art of computer vision. This does not mean
that a visual sensor that only provides standard contrast and motion information to
the visual cortex is not already a useful prosthesis for visual observation tasks. This
means that this is not going to help for embedded vision (i.e. vision in action).

This work focuses on the early visual system, considering local computations and emer-
gent global properties. However, this is only one aspect, and much is to be studied regarding
higher cortical areas, and other structures that are involved in the behavioral responses
considered here. Here are a few issues regarding next steps, beyond this work:

• Study and inclusion of the core and matrix pulvinar, in order to incrementally add
other cortical areas to the system, and exploit more sophisticated thalamocortical
processing

120

Chapter 5. Our minimal model in the real world: Experimental results

• Study and inclusion of thalamocortical learning (related to the pulvinar), to provide
the system with adaptability and memory, in order to learn new scenarios that are
not pre-wired, but acquired through time

• Addition of multi-order synchronization by the inclusion of gap junctions in TRN
This would allow us to better understand the thalamocortical regulation and syn-
chronization

• A more detailed study of the diﬀerent lesions that can be operated, and the related

performance impairment

• An improvement in speed of processing for the current development so it can be used

in real time circuits, essential point for robotics

• The modiﬁcation of the DNF mechanism used for V1, where instead of a DNF,

competing orientation maps should be implemented

The mystery of vision is still a work in progress. It will take many more studies, and
the combined eﬀorts of many people to work it out. Through our results studying the early
visual system, and the developing of our simulating environment, we have given one step
further into unraveling this mystery.

Conclusion (Fran¸cais)

“Great is the art of beginning, but greater is the art of ending”
– Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

Cet ´etude a ´et´e r´ealis´e pour explorer le rˆole du thalamus et de la voie visuelle non-
standard dans les r´eponses comportementales du syst`eme visuelle pr´ecoce. Ce travail a
aussi cherch´e `a d´evelopper un mod`ele computationnel pour tester nos hypoth`eses en sim-

dans ce sujet explore g´en´eralement les rˆoles et les interactions entre les voies dites “stan-
dard”: Parvocellulaire et Magnocellulaire, avec une accentuation particuli`ere sur cela qui se
passe au niveau du cerveau. Notre ´etude r´eutilise les id´ees principales de cette litt´erature,
en ajoutant des nouvelles sources qui ont ´etudi´e les voies visuelles non-standard. Nous
consid´erons le syst`eme visuelle pr´ecoce et son traitement, pour r´epondre `a ces questions:

1. Comment ce syst`eme visuelle non-standard aide des processus comportementaux,

plus sp´eciﬁquement de d´etection visuelle d’´ev´enements ?

2. Comment ces ﬂux d’information non-standard interagissent dans le syst`eme visuelle

pr´ecoce ?

3. Quel est le rˆole du thalamus dans la r´egulation et synchronisation des diﬀ´erents ﬂux

d’information montants et descendants ?

4. Peut-on compacter tout cela dans un logiciel et l’utiliser pour faire des simulations,
et ´eventuellement pour des applications au del`a de la compr´ehension du cerveau ?

123

Chapter 6. Our minimal model in the real world: Experimental results

Les r´esultats principaux de cet ´etude sont montr´es et discut´es dans le chapitre 4: Our
minimal model in the real world: Experimental results. Cette section synth´etise ces r´esultats
pour faire explicite la r´eponse que nous donnons aux quatre questions pos´es ici.

1. Comment ce syst`eme visuelle non-standard aide des processus comportementaux, plus

sp´eciﬁquement de d´etection visuelle d’´ev´enements ?

Through the coarse detection mechanisms present in the non-standard ganglion cells,
its output is able to communicate, via a direct connection, to the superior collicu-
lus, allowing rapid event/emergency behavior. The non-standard visual system thus
allows the superior colliculus to initiate an action without the need for cortical pro-
cessing.

Furthermore, the modulation imposed by the Konio cells to the cortex aﬀerences –in
both Parvo and Magno information ﬂows–, biases the response towards the detected
visual event. However, this bootstrapping information, fast but coarse when not spu-
rious, is regulated by the cortex to prevent a critical response to a “ghost” stimulus,
i.e. a stimulus not really present in the scene.

2. Comment ces ﬂux d’information non-standard interagissent dans le syst`eme visuelle

pr´ecoce ?

Mˆeme si ces ﬂux se d´eplacent en parall`ele tout au long de la majeure partie du
syst`eme visuel pr´ecoce, ils n’interagissent pas `a chaque ´etape. Au contraire, des
claires interactions existent entre eux au niveau du cortex visuel primaire, et du
colliculus sup´erieur, comme impl´ement´e dans notre mod`ele.

En V1, les deux ﬂux d’information standard (Parvo et Magno) sont modul´es s´epar´ement
par la voie non-standard (Konio). Dans le SC, non seulement l’information corticale
et de la r´etine sont prises en compte. Les deux voies standard sont m´elang´es, et,
ﬁnalement, le dSC calcule la d´ecision comportementale ﬁnale.

3. Quel est le rˆole du thalamus dans la r´egulation et synchronisation des diﬀ´erents ﬂux

d’information montants et descendants ?

Le thalamus est, `a premi`ere vue, une “relais” intelligent pour l’information de la
r´etine au cortex, lorsque l’on travaille en mode tonique. Il est un relais intelligent
parce que sa partie centrale traite ´egalement cette information, alors que l’information
colliculaire non-standard et le retour corticale sont pris en compte. Ce retour inﬂue
sur le traitement core `a la fois directement, et indirectement par TRN.

124

Chapter 6. Our minimal model in the real world: Experimental results

La partie de la matrix du thalamus est ´egalement r´egul´ee par TRN (qui sert de
r´egulateur thalamique `a tous les niveaux), mais semble manquer une connexion cor-
ticale. Bien que cette derni`ere aﬃrmation est contredite parfois dans la litt´erature,
nous avons opt´e pour l’approche classique.

Le TRN r´egule le thalamus, et donc cela est vrai pour tous les trois ﬂux d’information,
par inhibition s´elective. Cette inhibition est le r´esultat de la disparit´e thalamocortical:
ﬂux thalamiques montants contre les ﬂux des retours corticales. Le r´esultat de cette
disparit´e aide `a basculer en mode rafale (ou revenir au mode tonique), et de r´eguler
quelle information devrait passer, ou tout simplement combien d’elle, car il peut
ˆetre totalement inhib´ee, partiellement inhib´ee, ou pas inhib´ee. Cette inhibition est
topographique (cartographie un-`a-un sur la carte r´etinotopique).

4. Peut-on compacter tout cela dans un logiciel et l’utiliser pour faire des simulations,
et ´eventuellement pour des applications au del`a de la compr´ehension du cerveau ?

Oui, et peut-ˆetre oui. Nous pr´esentons dans ce travail un mod`ele informatique o`u
nous avons ´etudi´e nos hypoth`eses et r´eutilis´e les principales id´ees pr´esentes dans
la litt´erature, o`u l’on peut aussi facilement ´etudier des l´esions, et avec des algo-
rithmes relativement simples qui pourraient ˆetre utilis´es dans des robots simples, et
´eventuellement plus d´evelopp´es.

Pour les proth`eses, nous avons ´eclair´e un peu les emph “pourquoi/pour-quoi” l’information
r´etinienne est utilis´e. Le message principal est que une r´etine artiﬁcielle compl`ete ne
peut en aucun cas ˆetre “une cam´era connect´ee au thalamus”, alors qu’elle doit inclure
un pr´etraitement visuel `a l’´etat de l’´etat de l’art de la vision par ordinateur. Cela ne
signiﬁe pas qu’un capteur visuel qui fournit uniquement des informations standard
de contraste et de mouvement pour le cortex visuel n’est pas d´ej`a une proth`ese utile
pour des tˆaches d’observation visuelle. Cela signiﬁe que ce ne va pas aider `a la vision
embarqu´ee (c’est `a dire de la vision en action).

Ce travail se concentre sur le syst`eme visuel pr´ecoce, en considerant des calculs locaux
et propri´et´es globales ´emergentes. Cependant, ce n’est qu’un aspect, et beaucoup doit ˆetre
´etudi´e en ce qui concerne les zones corticales sup´erieures, et d’autres structures qui sont
impliqu´ees dans les r´eponses comportementales consid´er´ees ici. Voici quelques questions
concernant les prochaines ´etapes, au-del`a de ce travail:

• ´Etude et inclusion des pulvinar core et matrix, aﬁn d’ajouter progressivement d’autres

125

Chapter 6. Our minimal model in the real world: Experimental results

aires corticales du syst`eme, et d’exploiter des traitements thalamocorticaux plus so-
phistiqu´es

• ´Etude et inclusion de l’apprentissage thalamocortical (li´ee au pulvinar), pour fournir
le syst`eme d’une capacit´e d’adaptation et d’une m´emoire, aﬁn d’apprendre de nou-
veaux sc´enarios qui ne sont pas pr´e-cˆabl´es, mais acquis `a travers le temps

• Ajout de la synchronisation multi-ordre par l’inclusion des jonctions dans TRN Cela
nous permettrait de mieux comprendre la r´egularisation et la synchronisation thala-
mocorticales

• Une ´etude plus d´etaill´ee des diﬀ´erentes l´esions qui peuvent ˆetre exploit´es, et la perte

de performance li´ee `a telle l´esion

• Une am´elioration de la mise au point actuelle de sorte qu’elle puisse ˆetre utilis´e dans

des circuits en temps r´eel, comme dans la robotique, par exemple

• La modiﬁcation du m´ecanisme du DNF utilis´e pour V1, o`u, au lieu d’un DNF, des

cartes d’orientation en comp´etition doivent ˆetre impl´ement´ees

Le myst`ere de la vision est encore un travail en cours. Il faudra encore de nombreuses
´etudes, et les eﬀorts combin´es de nombreuses personnes pour s’en sortir. Grˆace `a nos
r´esultats qui ´etudient le syst`eme visuel pr´ecoce, et le d´eveloppement de notre environ-
nement de simulations, nous sommes all´es un peu plus loin pour ´eclairer ce myst`ere.

Other illustrations (simulations)

Here we present a few results from other simulations, just to show that the results shown
in the main text are not the only illustrative ones.

The markers have diﬀerent colors than previously shown. This does not replace the
previous markers. There is a diﬀerence: with natural images we use diﬀerent systems,
and present them with the markers; while with artiﬁcial stimuli the markers represent two
diﬀerent neural populations that collaborate to provide us with the green marker, used for
the computation of the degree of goodness of the simulation.

Weizmann database: Eli P-jump

For this simulation, we used the jump in position, done by subject “Eli”, from the

Weizmann database [9].

Youtube video I: Puppy

For this simulation, we used a video of a corgi pup running to the camera and then

sitting down in the position shown in the ﬁgure.

Youtube video II: Signature

For this simulation [3], we used a video of Britain’s Got Talent: the ﬁrst audition of

the dancing group “Signature”1.
