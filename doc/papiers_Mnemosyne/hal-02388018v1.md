Prediction learning
Value of Stimuli (Primary/Learned goals and sub-goals)

autonomous learning 

Decision Making
Value of Actions (motor decision, options, planning)

Interoception
•
• Motivational and 

emotional evaluation

• Exteroception
• Sensorimotor relations

Behavior and Cognition:
A matter of loops …

defining executive control for a cognitive agent in 
ecological conditions, by autonomous learning 
• Role of the loops between the frontal cortex and the basal 
ganglia for predicting values, decision making and planning 

• The limbic loops decide for the goal and the action 
• The associative loops bias the default behavior 
• The motor loops execute the behavior 
• Forward models associated with limbic and associative loops 
• The task set, powerful concept to describe this process 

We define our goals by ourselves : 
• detection of primary reinforcers 
• learning of secondary reinforcers 
• attentional processes 

We have a motivation to act : 
• Fundamental needs 
• intrinsic motivation 
• goal-driven behavior 

We self-evaluate our performances : 
• meta-control 

We associate different kinds of learning and 

information representation : 
• cues 
• abstractions 
• episodes 
• working memory 

We cumulate and re-exploit previously learnt 

knowledge and strategies in different context : 
• life-long learning and transfer learning 

We adapt even if the world is changing and uncertain : 
• stochasticity and volatility

Model-Based and Model-Free 
Reinforcement Learning

(Krack, 2010)

• Model-free (MF): long to learn, compact 
• Model-based (MB): use forward models, more 

flexible but heavy to compute 

• With forward models, goal-driven strategies 
more tractable than stimuli-driven strategies

role of the limbic loops : Foraging or decision between several targets ? 

• lOFC: learns values of stimuli (pavlov); menu dependent; sensory representation of 

rewards, consummatory behavior, Model Based; select the best two options 

• mOFC: reward representation for preparatory behavior (operant, Model Free), 

integrate levels of need; value difference signal; decide for the goal 

• ACC: integrate cost of effort to decide for the action; inverse value difference 

signal; if strong signal of conflict, ask for a switch 

• FEF: orientation toward the goal 
• MC: move forward for goal consumption

(Sutton, 1990)

• MF controls the behavior 
• Mb trains mf by replays (retrospective memory) 
And simulations (prospective memory)

Task Set 

Set of Rewarding S-R associations 
learned in the same context 

• Use the default task set, or switch 

or create a new one 

• Exogenous control (competition 

from stimuli) 

• Endogenous control (biasing from 

goals) 

associative loops : bias 
the default behavior

Top-down control of behavior 
by PFC And hippocampus 

• PFC can bias competition for 
 non-dominant behavior 
• Role of lPFC for Working 
Memory and attentional 
processeS 

• The Hippocampus can rapidly 

bind arbitrary representations 
not yet formed in the cortex 

• Explicit representation of 

episodes and replays 

• Define subgoals (intentions, 
means) and thoughts (covert 
actions encoded by their 
perceptual effects, forward 
models)

limbic and motor loops interactions
