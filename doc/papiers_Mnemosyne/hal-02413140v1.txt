AIM: build a vocal learning model underlying song learning in birds, and
understand how to make it biologically plausible.

INTRODUCTION

Sensorimotor learning: control problem which maps a sensory input into a
motor output.

Imitation: the ability to replicate another’s behaviour, i.e. to
generate an appropriate motor command to reproduce a sensory stimulus.

Inverse model learning: use the desired and actual motor configuration
to estimate the motor commands needed to reach the desired configuration
(to produce the appropriate sensory stimulus).

VOCAL LEARNING IN BIRDS T U T O R

a.  Adult zebra finch song

Learning phases:

Sensory phase Building neural representation of the song.

Sensorimotor phase

b.  Subsong (babbling).

c.  Plastic song (temporally structured). Crystallization

Reinforcement learning: learn an action policy to maximize the expected
reward (which encode the goal of the learning).

SENSORIMOTOR MODEL COMPONENTS [1]

I)  Architecture

II) Learning rule

III) Exploration strategy

Motor control model ● Respiratory system and vocal organs.

● Anatomical properties and small size of birds make the

investigation of vocal fold mechanisms difficult.

● The vocal output is driven by a complex

gesture-dependent control scheme, and the brain does not control each
motor control parameter independently [2].

Perceptual space ● How the brain encodes sensory stimulus.

● Highly nonlinear dynamics.

● Low dimensional representation of the sensory space.

Amador et al.,2013

MOTOR CONTROL MODEL

PERCEPTUAL SPACE

AIM: learn the semantic modes in high-dimensional audio signals, and
build a latent space useful for exploration. In addition, have sound
production in the model.

AIM: have a lower dimensional representation of the physical acoustic
space, which is the sensory space (sound).

WaveGAN [3] ● Two player minimax game: generator VS discriminator [4]. ●
Inspired by DCGAN architecture [5].

Deep scattering transform [6] ● From MFCC coefficients introducing
wavelets. ● Scattering coefficients can be seen as a convolutional
neural networks.

GENERATOR

DATASET ● Recordings from an adult zebra finch with sampling rate 16000.

Random input

DATASET ● Recordings from an adult zebra finch with sampling

rate 44100.

● Downsampled single syllables. N = 4946 syllables.

PCA analysis

● N = 52 syllables. ● PCA analysis. ● k-means algorithm.

X = centroids

● Averaging window = 800 ● 1st and 2nd order coefficients. ● Cell array:
elements correspond to layers in the scattering transform.

PERSPECTIVES Motor control model ● Explore the possibility to use a
dynamical system model. ● More exaustive evaluation of the generative
modle.

Exploration strategy ● Intrinsic motivation to drive motor exploration.
● Investigate the geometrical properties of latent space generated with
the GAN.
