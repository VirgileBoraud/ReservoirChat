 Beyond the type inheritance inference

● Covering all RDFS entailments reduced to the rule schema developed here, e.g.:

○ property inference (e.g., if Bob is the son of Ali then Bob is of the same family 

as Ali)

○ range inference (e.g., if Bob is the son of Ali, then Bob is a male)
○ domain inference (e.g., if Bob is the son of Ali, then Ali is a human) 

etc…

● To what extent could it be applicable to description logics and OWL entailment 

rules?

● SWRL rules (i.e., inference rules expressed directly as rewriting rules on variables) 

stored in associative memories?

Fully compatible in the “deterministic case” (vanilla theory)
Requires additional constraints in the 2D case for 0 or ± 1 values

In an open world (i.e. if we do not consider an exhaustive universe),

Linking with possibility π / necessity ν theory

In VSA (π, ν) could be implemented either as a pair of real numbers, or as a complex 
number. 

● Similarity can be defined as the dot product in the hermitian space 

with the same interpretation

● VTB algebra and related operators seem generalizable

However there is no real “gain” to consider complex number apart from using the 
complex product instead of matrix product.

Conclusion/Perspectives

● Distributive, tightly coupled approach, drawing inspiration from biology and psychology
●

2 associative memories:

○
○

AM1 to store the ontological “facts”
AM2 to store the inference rules => used to disclose implicit relationships/memberships

●

●

Alternate implementation: compressed triplestore (computing the transitive closure)

Achievable inferences: 

○

RDFS entailments: 

■
■

concept inclusion an inheritance
property domains and ranges

○

extension to OWL ontologies: class complement, intersection, etc
Scalability, completeness, soundness on larger databases?
+
+ How to manage uncertainty? (possibility-necessity approach?)
+ How to update the associative memory to add the inferred relationships?
+ How to learn the inference rules from patterns discovered in AM1 ?

Nengo associative memory is read-only (though some work is aiming to implement learning within AMs, cf Voelker et al 2014)
