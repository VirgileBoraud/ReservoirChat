Step 1

Why is creative problem 
solving so important?

Step 2

Step 3 CPS, Divergent & Convergent Thinking

Creativity is a complex 
human process that can be 
observed in a high diversity 
of learning, professional, and 
personal tasks

Creative problem 
solving (CPS) is a way of 
using creativity to develop 
new ideas and solutions to 
problems

Encyclopedia of Creativity (Second Edition). San Diego: Academic Press, pp. 400-403.

Step 4

Divergent Thinking 
Components

Step 5 Creative problem solving with educational robotics

CPS can be supported with 
visuospatial constructive play 
objects (VCPO) or artefacts 
such as modular robotics

The ANR CreaMaker 
project aims to advance 
the study of individual 
and collective creative 
problem solving through 
educational robotics

of Creative Behavior, 1, pp. 3-14.

Step 6

Research Goal:
How the stress impacts on creativity & 
students' creative problem solving skills
 during wartime?

Educational robotics

Educational robotics 
is a cross-disciplinary area of students’ 
learning and present educational trend

To evaluate divergent thinking, 
learner-players are asked to solve 
the CPS #CreaCube playful 
task

Number of participants (N=33):
Nice group (Ukrainian students in France) 
- 17 students (normal conditions)
Kyiv group (Ukrainian students in Ukraine)
 - 16 students (difficult conditions: air raid 
sirens, sounds of explosions, cut of 
electricity, cold weather and no heating etc.)

Future/present 
robotics jobs:

● robotics teacher
● operator of multifunctional 

robotic systems
● robot designer
● designer of neuro-interfaces 

for robot management

● designer of "smart" houses
● unmanned aerial interface 

designer

● service engineer in robotics
● robotics programmer
● medical robot operator
● drone operator
● drone engineer

Module 1. The EU experience 
in digital transformation of 
education.
Module 2. The EU experience 
in STREAM education. 
Module 3. The EU experience 
in CPS with educational 
robotics.
