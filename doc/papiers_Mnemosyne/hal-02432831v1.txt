Abstract

Some people can mix two languages within the same sentence: this is
known as intra-sentential code-switching. The majority of computational
models on language comprehension are dedicated to one language. Some
bilingual models have also been developed, but very few have explored
the code-switching case. We collected data from human subjects that were
required to mix pairs of given sentences in French and English. Truly
bilingual subjects produced more switches within the same sentence. The
corpus obtained have some very complex mixed sentences: there can be
until eleven language switches within the same sentence. Then, we
trained ResPars, a Reservoir-based sentence Parsing model, with the
collected corpus. This Recurrent Neural Network model processes
sentences incrementally, word by word, and outputs the sentence meaning
(i.e.Â thematic roles). Surprisingly the model is able to learn and
generalize on the mixed corpus with performances nearly as good as the
unmixed French-English corpus.
