-   What is reservoir computing?

-   What is a readout?

-   Why the name ‘reservoir’?

-   Why the name “readout”?

-   On which tasks is reservoir computing good?

-   On which tasks is reservoir computing bad?

-   Approximately how many neurons should be used (10, 100, 1000, 1
    million)?

-   What is the purpose of the ridge in readout?

-   How are the weights set in the reservoir?

-   Does the input weights learn from the neurons in the reservoir?

Intermediate

    computing?

-   Are there other forms of reservoir computing?

-   Why is it called “computing at the edge of chaos”?

-   What is the “echo state property”?

-   What is the paper that introduces reservoir computing?

-   What are all the hyper-parameters?

-   How do you choose the hyper-parameters?

Advanced

-   What is a liquid state machine?

-   How explainable are reservoir computing models?

-   How much do the results vary between two differently initialised
    reservoirs?

-   What influence does the sparsity of the weight matrix have on
    performance?

-   What is a deep reservoir?

-   Can you give me the method to implement a deep reservoir?
