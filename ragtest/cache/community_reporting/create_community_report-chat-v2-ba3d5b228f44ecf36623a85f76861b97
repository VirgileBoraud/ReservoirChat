This concept is proposed by Miller (1956) and also suggests that it is the maximum number of items that can be held in Working Memory for immediate use. The Immediate Memory Span's significance in the field of psychology is evident in its relationship with Grossberg's research, which highlights a distinction between the Immediate Memory Span and a Transient Memory Span.
