Initially, they discuss the concept of authority and obedience, with Le Roi giving orders to Le Petit Prince, who is hesitant to obey due to intimidation. However, Le Roi also shows a benevolent side to his character by granting a favor to Le Petit Prince. The two entities also converse about self-judgment and justice, as well as the little prince's desire to leave and the king's desire to keep him as a subject.\n\nLe Petit Prince is affected by Le Roi's orders and decides to leave, demonstrating a sense of obedience and respect for authority. In contrast, Le Petit Prince also compares the lamp lighter to the king, implying that the lamp lighter is more relatable and less concerned with appearances. Additionally, Le Petit Prince visits Le Roi on one of the asteroids and is curious about the king's simplicity in recognizing him.\n\nFurthermore, Le Petit Prince draws parallels between the businessman and a king who does not own stars, suggesting that both are disconnected from the true value of things.

However, it is also mentioned that Le Roi is an example of someone who does not own stars, contrasting with the businessman's claim. This apparent contradiction can be resolved by understanding that Le Roi's claim of control may be metaphorical or symbolic, rather than literal.
