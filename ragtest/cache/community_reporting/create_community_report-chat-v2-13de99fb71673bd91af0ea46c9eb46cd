A Spectral Radius close to 1 allows the reservoir states to be less affected by their initial conditions, leading to stable dynamics. On the other hand, a Spectral Radius further from 1 can lead to chaotic dynamics, where the reservoir's behavior becomes unpredictable and highly sensitive to initial conditions. This has theoretical implications for the reservoir states and can potentially affect the performance of reservoir computing models.
