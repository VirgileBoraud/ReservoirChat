{"result": "\n{\n   \t\"title\"\t:\t\"Probability Distributions: Normal and Bernoulli\"\t,\n   \t\"summary\"\t:\t\"The community revolves around two key entities: Normal Distribution and Bernoulli Random Variable. Normal Distribution is a probability distribution characterized by its bell-shaped curve, while Bernoulli Random Variable is a binary variable that takes the value 1 with probability p and 0 with probability 1-p. These entities are related to each other through their usage in generating matrices and their different characteristics as probability distributions.
