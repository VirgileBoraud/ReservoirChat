Interpolation is used to estimate values between known data points, adjust sequence lengths, and achieve exact fits in curve fitting. Extrapolation, on the other hand, is used to predict values beyond the range of known data points. The two methods are closely related and often used together, with Interpolation focusing on known data points and Extrapolation extending beyond this range.

It is primarily used in curve fitting to achieve an exact fit to the data. Additionally, interpolation is employed to adjust the length of sequences by interpolating additional points. Furthermore, interpolation is a technique used to estimate unknown quantities between known quantities, often used in the construction of economic time series. It is also used to estimate values between known data points. Lastly, interpolation is a technique used to approximate a function when only a set of points is provided, and the function is an operation on the real numbers. In summary, interpolation is a method used to estimate or approximate values between known data points, adjust the length of sequences, and achieve an exact fit to the data in curve fitting, all while being a technique to approximate functions with real numbers.\",5\n674,\"\"\"EXTRAPOLATION\"\"\",\" Extrapolation is a versatile method that serves multiple purposes. It is primarily used to adjust the length of sequences by reducing points to match a common length. Additionally, extrapolation is employed to estimate values beyond the range of known data points, predict values of a function beyond the observed data, and approximate a function when only a set of points is provided. It is important to note that these estimations and predictions are subject to a degree of uncertainty. Extrapolation is also a technique used in mathematical operations on real numbers. In essence, extrapolation is a method used to extend known data points or a relationship derived from them beyond their original domain. However, it is crucial to understand that extrapolation carries a higher degree of uncertainty compared to interpolation, as it involves making predictions based on limited information.\",3\n1005,\"\"\"ECONOMIC TIME SERIES\"\"\",\"\"\"Economic Time Series refers to the collection and analysis of data points indexed in time order, used for various economic purposes.\"\"\",2\n1007,\"\"\"POLYNOMIAL INTERPOLATION\"\"\",\"\"\"Polynomial Interpolation is a method that fits piecewise polynomial functions into time intervals to estimate values.\"\"\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\n1305,\"\"\"INTERPOLATION\"\"\",\"\"\"CURVE FITTING\"\"\",\"\"\"Interpolation is a method used in Curve Fitting to construct an exact fit to the data.\"\"\",10\n1309,\"\"\"EXTRAPOLATION\"\"\",\"\"\"CURVE FITTING\"\"\",\"\"\"Extrapolation is the use of a fitted curve beyond the range of the observed data in Curve Fitting.\"\"\",8\n1304,\"\"\"INTERPOLATION\"\"\",\"\"\"EXTRAPOLATION\"\"\",\" Interpolation and Extrapolation are techniques used to estimate values, with Interpolation focusing on known data points and Extrapolation extending beyond the range of known data points.
