It involves assigning a single label to each input sequence, making it a problem where the codomain of a function is a finite set. Additionally, classification is a task that involves categorizing data into distinct classes or categories. This process can be applied to time series patterns, such as identifying a word based on hand movements. In essence, classification is the process of assigning input data to one of several predefined categories or classes.\",9\n864,\"\"\"REGRESSION\"\"\",\" Regression is a statistical technique that is primarily used for approximating a function, specifically a function that operates on the real numbers. Additionally, regression is a predictive modeling technique that involves predicting a continuous value based on input data. This method is used to understand and model the relationship between input variables and a continuous output variable.\",3\n1013,\"\"\"STATISTICAL LEARNING THEORY\"\"\",\" Statistical Learning Theory is a field that focuses on increasing the capacity of models through optimization techniques.
