It explains how the brain autonomously learns to categorize, recognize, and predict objects and events in a changing world. The theory is mentioned in the text as a related concept to MTM. ART is a neural network model that focuses on the role of attention in learning and recognition. It was introduced to propose how top-down learned expectations and attentional focusing could dynamically stabilize learning in a Competitive Learning or Self-Organizing Map model. In essence, Adaptive Resonance Theory is a learning model that aims to stabilize learning in response to input patterns by incorporating the role of attention.\",8\n387,\"\"\"BAM\"\"\",\" \"\"BAM\"\" is a type of model that applies to learning laws, such as the passive decay associative law and the signal Hebb law.
