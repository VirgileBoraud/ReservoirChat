Indeed, another inspiration\nfor BAM was Adaptive Resonance Theory, or ART.\n\nAdaptive Resonance Theory\n\nAdaptive Resonance Theory, or ART, is currently the most advanced\ncognitive and bRNN theory of how the brain autonomously learns to\ncategorize, recognize, and predict objects and events in a changing\nworld. To a remarkable degree, humans can rapidly learn new facts\nwithout being forced to just as rapidly forget what they already know.\nGrossberg (1980) called this problem the stability-plasticity dilemma.\nIt is also sometimes called the problem of catastrophic forgetting\n(Carpenter, 2001; French, 1999; Page, 2000). ART proposes a solution of\nthis problem by demonstrating how top-down expectations (Figure 7) can\nlearn to focus attention on salient combinations of cues (\u201ccritical\nfeature patterns\u201d), and characterizing how attention may operate via a\nform of self-normalizing \u201cbiased competition\u201d (Desimone, 1998). In\nparticular, when a good enough match between a bottom-up input pattern\nand a top-down expectation occurs, a synchronous resonant state emerges\nthat embodies an attentional focus and is capable of driving fast\nlearning of bottom-up recognition categories and top-down expectations;\nhence the name adaptive resonance.
