In order for the ESN principle to work, the\nreservoir must have the echo state property (ESP), which relates\nasymptotic properties of the excited reservoir dynamics to the driving\nsignal. Intuitively, the ESP states that the reservoir will\nasymptotically wash out any information from initial conditions. The ESP\nis guaranteed for additive-sigmoid neuron reservoirs, if the reservoir\nweight matrix (and the leaking rates) satisfy certain algebraic\nconditions in terms of singular values. For such reservoirs with a tanh\nsigmoid, the ESP is violated for zero input if the spectral radius of\nthe reservoir weight matrix is larger than unity. Conversely, it is\nempirically observed that the ESP is granted for any input if this\nspectral radius is smaller than unity. This has led in the literature to\na far-spread but erroneous identification of the ESP with a spectral\nradius below 1. Specifically, the larger the input amplitude, the\nfurther above unity the spectral radius may be while still obtaining the\nESP.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "TechxGenus/Codestral-22B-v0.1-GPTQ", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
