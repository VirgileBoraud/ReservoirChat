Fitted curves can be\nused as an aid for data visualization,[21][22] to infer values of a\nfunction where no data are available,[23] and to summarize the\nrelationships among two or more variables.[24] Extrapolation refers to\nthe use of a fitted curve beyond the range of the observed data,[25] and\nis subject to a degree of uncertainty[26] since it may reflect the\nmethod used to construct the curve as much as it reflects the observed\ndata.\n\nFor processes that are expected to generally grow in magnitude\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "TechxGenus/Codestral-22B-v0.1-GPTQ", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
