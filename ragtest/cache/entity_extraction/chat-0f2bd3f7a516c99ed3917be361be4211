Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Schomaker (1990 [= chapter 7 in Schomaker 1991], 1992), who described\nhow a desired target output from an RNN can be obtained by learning to\ncombine signals from a randomly configured ensemble of spiking neural\noscillators.\n\nFor an illustration, consider the task of training an RNN to behave as a\ntunable frequency generator (download the MATLAB code of this example).\nThe input signal (u(n)) is a slowly varying frequency setting, the\ndesired output (y(n)) is a sinewave of a frequency indicated by the\ncurrent input. Assume that a training input-output sequence (D =\n(u(1),y(1)), , (u(n_{max}),y(n_{max}))) is given (see the input and\noutput signals in ; here the input is a slow random step function\nindicating frequencies ranging from 1/16 to 1/4 Hz). The task is to\ntrain a RNN from these training data such that on slow test input\nsignals, the output is again a sinewave of the input-determined\nfrequency.\n\nIn the ESN approach, this task is solved by the following steps.\n\nContents\n\nVariants\n\nEcho state networks can be set up with or without direct trainable\ninput-to-output connections, with or without output-to-reservoir\nfeedback, with different neuron types, different\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "TechxGenus/Codestral-22B-v0.1-GPTQ", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
