One can\ndistinguish two major classes of function approximation problems: First,\nfor known target functions, approximation theory is the branch of\nnumerical analysis that investigates how certain known functions (for\nexample, special functions) can be approximated by a specific class of\nfunctions (for example, polynomials or rational functions) that often\nhave desirable properties (inexpensive computation, continuity, integral\nand limit values, etc.).\n\nSecond, the target function, call it g, may be unknown; instead of an\nexplicit formula, only a set of points (a time series) of the form (x,\ng(x)) is provided. Depending on the structure of the domain and codomain\nof g, several techniques for approximating g may be applicable. For\nexample, if g is an operation on the real numbers, techniques of\ninterpolation, extrapolation, regression analysis, and curve fitting can\nbe used. If the codomain (range or target set) of g is a finite set, one\nis dealing with a classification problem instead. A related problem of\nonline time series approximation[29] is to summarize the data in\none-pass and construct an approximate representation\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "TechxGenus/Codestral-22B-v0.1-GPTQ", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
