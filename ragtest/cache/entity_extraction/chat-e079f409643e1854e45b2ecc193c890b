For instance, if the dataset contains image data, additional preprocessing steps like normalization or augmentation might be required. If it contains text data, tokenization and embedding might be necessary. The objective function and the way you split the dataset into training and testing sets might also differ based on the type of data and the specific requirements of the model being used. \nQuestion: What is the file from the 'config' parameter, where does it come from?\nAnswer: The 'config' parameter refers to a configuration file that defines the hyperparameters and settings for the hyperparameter optimization process.
