The main idea\nis (i) to drive a random, large, fixed recurrent neural network with the\ninput signal, thereby inducing in each neuron within this \u201creservoir\u201d\nnetwork a nonlinear response signal, and (ii) combine a desired output\nsignal by a trainable linear combination of all of these response\nsignals.\n\nThe basic idea of ESNs is shared with Liquid State Machines (LSM), which\nwere developed independently from and simultaneously with ESNs by\nWolfgang Maass (Maass W., Natschlaeger T., Markram H. 2002).\nIncreasingly often, LSMs, ESNs and the more recently explored\nBackpropagation Decorrelation learning rule for RNNs (Schiller and Steil\n2005) are subsumed under the name of Reservoir Computing. Schiller and\nSteil (2005) also showed that in traditional training methods for RNNs,\nwhere all weights (not only the output weights) are adapted, the\ndominant changes are in the output weights. In cognitive neuroscience, a\nrelated mechanism has been investigated by Peter F. Dominey in the\ncontext of modelling sequence processing in mammalian brains, especially\nspeech recognition in the human brain (e\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "TechxGenus/Codestral-22B-v0.1-GPTQ", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
