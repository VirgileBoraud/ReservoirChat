Symmetry-breaking implies a noise suppression\nproperty when it is coupled to an on-center off-surround anatomy\n(Grossberg, 1988). Then the network suppresses uniformly active inputs\nand generates suprathreshold responses only to inputs that are larger\nthan a baseline value, or adaptation level. This property illustrates\nthat excitation and inhibition need to be properly balanced to achieve\nefficient neuronal dynamics: When excitation is too large, seizure\nactivity can occur in a bRNN. When inhibition is too large, processing\ncan never get started. Symmetry-breaking can be achieved during\ndevelopment by an opposites attract rule whereby the relative sizes of\nthe intracellular excitatory and inhibitory saturation voltages (V^+)\nand (V^-) control the relative total strengths of the intercellular\noff-surround and on-center connections, respectively (Grossberg, 1978a,\nSection 45).\n\nRecurrent competitive fields\n\nThe activities (x_i) in (13) rapidly decay if their inputs (I_i) are\nshut off. Persistent storage in STM is achieved when feedback signals\nexist among the various populations, thereby creating a bRNN.
