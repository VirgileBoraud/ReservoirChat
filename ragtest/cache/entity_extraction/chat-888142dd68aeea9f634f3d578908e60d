This property is achieved if signal\nvelocity is proportional to axon length. But signal velocity is a local\nproperty of signal transmission, whereas axon length is a global\nproperty of the anatomy. How can this global property be controlled by a\nlocal one? This is possible if axon length is proportional to axon\ndiameter, and signal velocity is proportional to axon diameter. The\nlatter is often the case during spike transmission down an axon (Ruch et\nal., 1961, p.\u00a073) and the former is qualitatively true: longer axons are\nusually thicker; see Cohen and Grossberg (1986) for developmental laws\nwhereby this can happen.
