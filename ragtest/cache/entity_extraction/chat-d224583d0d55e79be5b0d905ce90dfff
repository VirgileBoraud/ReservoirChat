In such a network,\nlist chunks are the sampling cells that are linked through serial\nlearning into a temporally ordered circuit. List chunks also play the\nrole of planning nodes through read-out of their learned top-down\nspatial patterns and serial links. Such a network is called a\nContext-Sensitive Self-Organizing Avalanche, or a Context-Sensitive\nAvalanche, for short.\n\nSerial learning\n\nIssues about what previous events control subsequent responses were\narticulated in the classical literature about serial verbal learning.\nNew verbal units are continually being synthesized as a result of\npractice, and need not be the obvious units that the experimentalist is\ndirectly manipulating. Indeed, entire sequences of previous events can\ncreate the context that determines the next response. The same problem\narises in verbal, spatial, and motor learning. The concept of list\nchunks was introduced to explain such learned sequence-sensitive\ncontextual control.\n\nThe severity of such difficulties led the serial learning expert Young\n(1968, p.\u00a0146) to write: \u201cIf an investigator is interested in studying\nverbal learning processes \u2026 he would do well to choose some method other\nthan serial learning\u201d.
