Adaptive\nResonance Theory, or ART, was introduced in Grossberg (1976b) to propose\nhow top-down learned expectations and attentional focusing could\ndynamically stabilize learning in a Competitive Learning or\nSelf-Organizing Map model in response to an arbitrary series of input\npatterns.\n\nAdaptive Bidirectional Associative Memory\n\nKosko (1987, 1988) adapted the Cohen-Grossberg model and Liapunov\nfunction (Cohen and Grossberg, 1983), which proved global convergence of\nSTM, to define a system that combines STM and LTM and which also\nglobally converges to a limit. The main trick was to observe how the\nsymmetric connections in the Cohen-Grossberg equation (32) could be used\nto define symmetric LTM traces interacting reciprocally between two\nprocessing levels. An Additive Model BAM system is, accordingly, defined\nby:\n\n[ x_i = -x_i + k f(y_k) z{ki} + I_i ]\n\nand\n\n[ y_j = -y_j + m f(x_m) z{mj} + J_i. ]\n\nA Shunting Model BAM can also be analogously defined. One type of\nlearning law to which BAM methods apply is the passive decay associative\nlaw that was introduced in Grossberg (1967, 1968b, 1968c); see\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "TechxGenus/Codestral-22B-v0.1-GPTQ", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
