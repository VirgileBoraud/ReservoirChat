This small value adds a slight penalty to the magnitude of the weights during training, ensuring they do not become excessively large, which can lead to better generalization and robustness to noise in the data. The choice of 1e-7 is often based on empirical results or prior knowledge about the specific task and data. \nQuestion: What are the teacher vectors?\nAnswer: Teacher vectors are the target outputs used during the training of a machine learning model. In supervised learning, each input example \\( x_i \\) in the training dataset has a corresponding teacher vector \\( y_i \\), which represents the desired output for that input. The model learns by adjusting its parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and these teacher vectors, thereby enabling it to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. \nQuestion: Why do we need to define a training task?\nAnswer: Defining a training task is essential because it specifies the objective the model needs to achieve, such as predicting future values or classifying data. It involves providing input-output pairs (training data) that guide the model in learning the relationship between inputs and desired outputs.
