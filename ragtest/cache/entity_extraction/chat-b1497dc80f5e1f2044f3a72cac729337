Practical\n\u201ctricks of the trade\u201d are collected in Luko\u0161evi\u010dius (2012).\n\nSignificance\n\nA number of algorithms for the supervised training of RNNs have been\nknown since the early 1990s, most notably real-time recurrent learning\n(Williams and Zipser 1989), backpropagation through time (Werbos 1990),\nextended Kalman filtering based methods (Puskorius and Feldkamp 2004),\nand the Atiya-Parlos algorithm (Atiya and Parlos 2000). All of these\nalgorithms adapt all connections (input, recurrent, output) by some\nversion of gradient descent. This renders these algorithms slow, and\nwhat is maybe even more cumbersome, makes the learning process prone to\nbecome disrupted by bifurcations (Doya 1992); convergence cannot be\nguaranteed. As a consequence, RNNs were rarely fielded in practical\nengineering applications at the time when ESNs were introduced. ESN\ntraining, by contrast, is fast, does not suffer from bifurcations, and\nis easy to implement. On a number of benchmark tasks, ESNs have starkly\noutperformed\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "TechxGenus/Codestral-22B-v0.1-GPTQ", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
