However, more importantly, empirical investigations can\nindicate the advantage of using predictions derived from non-linear\nmodels, over those from linear models, as for example in nonlinear\nautoregressive exogenous models. Further references on nonlinear time\nseries analysis: (Kantz and Schreiber),[34] and (Abarbanel)[35]\n\nAmong other types of non-linear time series models, there are models to\nrepresent the changes of variance over time (heteroskedasticity). These\nmodels represent autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH)\nand the collection comprises a wide variety of representation (GARCH,\nTARCH, EGARCH, FIGARCH, CGARCH, etc.). Here changes in variability are\nrelated to, or predicted by, recent past values of the observed series.\nThis is in contrast to other possible representations of locally varying\nvariability, where the variability might be modelled as being driven by\na separate time-varying process, as in a doubly stochastic model.\n\nIn recent work on model-free analyses, wavelet transform based methods\n(for example locally stationary wavelets and wavelet decomposed neural\nnetworks) have gained favor.[36] Multiscale (often referred to as\nmultiresolution) techniques decompose a given time series, attempting to\nillustrate time dependence at multiple scales.
