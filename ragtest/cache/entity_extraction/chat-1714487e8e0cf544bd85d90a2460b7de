As schematised in\nFigure 1, a node is a recurrent operator which maps its internal state\nst and some input vector xt at a timestep t with the next state st+1.\nThis mapping is defined by the function f, which can be implemented by\nusers as a simple Python function operating on a node and an input\nvector stored as a numpy array. A node can also carry parameters (e.g.\u00a0a\nweight or bias matrix), stored as numpy arrays or scipy sparse matrices\nfor efficiency. These parameters may be updated during the training\nphase of the node. Learning rules are also defined as Python functions\npassed to the node class constructor. Finally, nodes can be connected\ntogether inside directed acyclic graphs to represent more complex\noperations. This mechanism allows to chain node functions. A graph of\nnodes is represented by the Model class, which is a subclass of the\nabstract Node class, and therefore share the same API as nodes. This\nallows to chain models together, or train them as a whole. Connections\nbetween nodes may also be delayed. These type of connections are called\nfeedback connections. Some node operators may therefore be of the form f\n: st, xt, yt\u22121 \ufffd\u2192 st+1, where y is an external signal, generally coming\nfrom other nodes in a model. st represents to internal state of the\nreservoir and xt represent some input value.
