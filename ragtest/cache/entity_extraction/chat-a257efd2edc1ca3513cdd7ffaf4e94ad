Most commonly, a time series is a\nsequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a\nsequence of discrete-time data. Examples of time series are heights of\nocean tides, counts of sunspots, and the daily closing value of the Dow\nJones Industrial Average.\n\nA time series is very frequently plotted via a run chart (which is a\ntemporal line chart). Time series are used in statistics, signal\nprocessing, pattern recognition, econometrics, mathematical finance,\nweather forecasting, earthquake prediction, electroencephalography,\ncontrol engineering, astronomy, communications engineering, and largely\nin any domain of applied science and engineering which involves temporal\nmeasurements.\n\nTime series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in\norder to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the\ndata. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future\nvalues based on previously observed values. While regression analysis is\noften employed in such a way as to test relationships between one or\nmore different time series, this type of analysis is not usually called\n\u201ctime series analysis\u201d, which refers in particular to relationships\nbetween different points in time within a single series.\n\nTime series data have a natural temporal ordering. This makes time\nseries analysis distinct from cross-sectional studies, in which there is\nno natural ordering of\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "TechxGenus/Codestral-22B-v0.1-GPTQ", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
