Transposition errors also\nhave a natural explanation in such a working memory, since stored items\nwith similar activity levels will transpose their relative activities,\nand thus their rehearsal order, more easily than items with very\ndifferent activity levels if noise perturbs these levels through time.\nGrossberg (1978a, 1978b) also proved that, if attention varies across\nitems, then multi-modal bows, or Von Restorff (1933) effects, also\ncalled isolation effects (Hunt and Lamb, 2001), can be obtained by\naltering the relative sizes of stored activities. Von Restorff effects\ncan also be caused by rate and feature similarity differences across\nitems, factors that also influence bowing in the present modeling\nframework. Associative and competitive mechanisms can also cause Von\nRestorff effects during serial verbal learning (see Serial learning and\nGrossberg, 1969, 1974).\n\nGrossberg (1978a) distinguished between the classical immediate memory\nspan (IMS) of Miller (1956) and the then new concept of the transient\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "TechxGenus/Codestral-22B-v0.1-GPTQ", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
