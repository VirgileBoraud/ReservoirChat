For more detailed information, you can refer to the [ReservoirPy documentation](https://reservoirpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/hyper.html). \nQuestion: What is the spectral radius?\nAnswer: The spectral radius is the largest absolute value of the eigenvalues of the reservoir matrix in an Echo State Network (ESN). It determines the stability and memory capacity of the reservoir. A spectral radius close to 1 helps the reservoir states to be less affected by initial conditions, enhancing the network's ability to memorize past inputs. \nQuestion: What does changing the chaoticity of the reservoir dynamics do?\nAnswer: Changing the chaoticity of the reservoir dynamics, influenced by the spectral radius, alters the behavior of the reservoir neurons. A higher spectral radius can lead to more chaotic dynamics, which might improve the network's ability to process complex temporal patterns but can also make it less stable. Conversely, a lower spectral radius results in more stable, less chaotic dynamics, which might be easier to control but could reduce the network's flexibility in capturing intricate patterns.
