Competition between command cells can then determine\nwhich ritualistic behavior the system will activate.\n\nGrossberg (1978a) describes a series of increasingly sophisticated\nmechanisms that modulate Avalanche performance, leading to ever-greater\nsensitivity to environmental feedback, including recurrent interactions.\nThese include issues such as sensitivity to the value of actions for\nachieving desired goals, and the ability to volitionally decide what\nactions to perform and at what speed.\n\nConcerning the former issue: There is a difference between aborting your\ndance on stage if the theater is being consumed by flames, and risking\nyour career because a mosquito is hovering above. Only more important\nevents should be able to shut off the arousal that supports a given act.\nKnowing what is important to an organism requires that the network can\nevaluate what events are rewarding and punishing. This issue\nhistorically led to the Cognitive-Emotional-Motor (CogEM) theory of\nreinforcement learning in which incentive motivation plays the role of a\nconditionable form of nonspecific arousal, and competition between\ndifferent drive representations that control the incentive motivation\ncan determine switching between different valued actions (Grossberg,\n1971a, 1972a, 1972b, 1975; see also Armony et al.\u00a0(1995) and\nComputational models\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "TechxGenus/Codestral-22B-v0.1-GPTQ", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
