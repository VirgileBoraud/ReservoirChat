input.\n\nThis can be used to create a closed-loop system, where the output of the\nESN is fed back into the input.\n\nThis can be useful for generating signals, or for long term forecasting.\n\nIn ReservoirPy, feedback connections can be added by setting the `feedback`\nparameter to `True` when creating a reservoir.\n\n    reservoir = rpy.Reservoir(100, sr=1.2, rc_distrib=rpy.distributions.Uniform(0, 1),\n                              input_scaling=0.5, feedback=True)\n\n    states = reservoir.run(X_train)\n\n    reader = rpy.Ridge(0.01, solver=\"pinv\")\n\n    reader.train(states, Y_train)\n\n    Y_pred = reader.run(states)\n\n    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 3))\n\n    plt.title(\"Training data and prediction.\")\n\n    plt.ylabel(\"$sin(t)$\")\n\n    plt.xlabel(\"$t$\")\n\n    plt.plot(X_train, label=\"Training data\")\n\n    plt.plot(np.concatenate((Y_pred, np.zeros((1, 1)))), label=\"Prediction\")\n\n    plt.legend()\n\n    plt.show()\n\nGeneration and long term forecasting\n\nFeedback connections can also be used for generating signals, or for long term forecasting.\n\nThis is because the output of the ESN is fed back into the input, allowing the ESN to generate new data.\n\nThis can be useful for tasks such as music generation, or for forecasting weather patterns over long periods of time.\n\n    X_pred = np.zeros((50, 1))\n\n    X_pred[0] = X_train[-1]\n\n    for i in range(1, 50):\n\n        X_pred[i] = Y_pred[i-1]\n\n\n\n    states = reservoir.run(X_pred)\n\n    Y_pred = reader.run(states)\n\n    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 3))\n\n    plt.title(\"Prediction.\")\n\n    plt.ylabel(\"$sin(t)$\")\n\n    plt.xlabel(\"$t$\")\n\n    plt.plot(np.concatenate((X_train, X_pred)), label=\"Prediction\")\n\n    plt.legend()\n\n    plt.show()\n\nCustom weight matrices\n\nCustom weight matrices can be used to create more complex ESNs.\n\nThis can be useful for tasks such as image classification, or for modeling complex systems.\n\nIn ReservoirPy, custom weight matrices can be added by setting the `W` parameter to a custom matrix when creating a reservoir.\n\n    W = np.random.rand(100, 100)\n\n    reservoir = rpy.Reservoir(100, W=W)\n\nParallelization\n\nReservoirPy supports parallelization, allowing for faster training of ESNs.\n\nThis can be useful for tasks such as image classification, or for modeling complex systems.\n\nIn ReservoirPy, parallelization can be enabled by setting the `parallel` parameter to `True` when creating a reservoir.\n\n    reservoir = rpy.Reservoir(100, parallel=True)\n\n\"Deep\" architectures\n\n\"Deep\" architectures can be created by stacking multiple ESNs together.\n\nThis can be useful for tasks such as image classification, or for modeling complex systems.\n\nIn ReservoirPy, \"deep\" architectures can be created by stacking multiple reservoirs together, and connecting the output of one reservoir to the input of the next reservoir.\n\n    reservoir1 = rpy.Reservoir(100)\n\n    reservoir2 = rpy.Reservoir(100)\n\n    states1 = reservoir1.run(X_train)\n\n    states2 = reservoir2.run(states1)\n\n    reader = rpy.Ridge(0.01, solver=\"pinv\")\n\n    reader.train(states2, Y_train)\n\n    Y_pred = reader.run(states2)\n\n    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 3))\n\n    plt.title(\"Training data and prediction.\")\n\n

plt.legend()\n\n    plt.show()\n\nExamples folder\n\nThe examples folder contains example of complex use cases from the literature.\n\nThese examples can be used to learn more about the capabilities of ReservoirPy, and to see how it can be used to solve complex problems.\n\n    import os\n\n
