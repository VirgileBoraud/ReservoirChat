The Hebb postulate assumed the wrong processing unit: It is not\nthe strength of an individual connection; rather it is a distributed\npattern of LTM traces.\n\nOne variant of gated steepest descent learning, called Outstar Learning,\nwas introduced in Grossberg (1968b) for spatial pattern learning (Figure\n1 and Figure 2).\n\nAnother variant is called Instar Learning, which was used in Grossberg\n(1976a) for the learning of bottom-up adaptive filters (Figure 3) in\nSelf-Organizing Map (SOM) models [6]. A SOM uses a recurrent on-center\noff-surround network (Figure 4) to choose one, or a small number, of\ncells for storage in STM (see Processing and STM of Spatial Patterns),\nbefore the stored activities trigger learning of LTM traces in abutting\nsynapses (see Sparse Stable Category Learning Theorem). Kohonen (1984)\nalso used Instar Learning in his applications of the SOM model.\n\nOutstar and Instar Learning are dual networks in the sense that they are\nthe same, except for reversing which cells are sampling and which are\nsampled (Figure 5).\n\nOutstars and Instars were combined in Grossberg (1976a) to form a\nthree-layer Instar-Outstar network for learning multi-dimensional maps\nfrom any m-dimensional input space to any n-dimensional output\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "TechxGenus/Codestral-22B-v0.1-GPTQ", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
