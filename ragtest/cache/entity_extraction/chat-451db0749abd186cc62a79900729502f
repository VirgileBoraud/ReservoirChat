This means that the found cluster centers are\nnon-descriptive for the dataset because the cluster centers are always\nnonrepresentative sine waves.\n\nModels[edit]\n\nModels for time series data can have many forms and represent different\nstochastic processes. When modeling variations in the level of a\nprocess, three broad classes of practical importance are the\nautoregressive (AR) models, the integrated (I) models, and the\nmoving-average (MA) models. These three classes depend linearly on\nprevious data points.[33] Combinations of these ideas produce\nautoregressive moving-average (ARMA) and autoregressive integrated\nmoving-average (ARIMA) models. The autoregressive fractionally\nintegrated moving-average (ARFIMA) model generalizes the former three.\nExtensions of these classes to deal with vector-valued data are\navailable under the heading of multivariate time-series models and\nsometimes the preceding acronyms are extended by including an initial\n\u201cV\u201d for \u201cvector\u201d, as in VAR for vector autoregression.
