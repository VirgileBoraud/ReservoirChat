This capability makes them suitable for tasks like unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition and speech recognition.  **Classes of Networks**  - **Infinite Impulse Response (IIR)**: The term \"recurrent neural network\" typically refers to networks with an infinite impulse response. These networks are characterized by directed cyclic graphs that cannot be unrolled. - **Finite Impulse Response (FIR)**: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) belong to the class of finite impulse response networks. A finite impulse recurrent network is a directed acyclic graph that can be unrolled and replaced with a strictly feedforward neural network.  **Temporal Dynamics**  Both infinite impulse and finite impulse networks exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. This dynamic nature allows them to handle sequences and time-dependent data effectively.  **Gated States and Memory**  - **Gated States**: Additional stored states and controlled storage mechanisms can be added to both IIR and FIR networks. These controlled states, known as gated states or gated memory, are integral to long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs). - **Feedback Neural Network (FNN)**: Networks that incorporate time delays or feedback loops, replacing standard storage, are also referred to as Feedback Neural Networks.  **Theoretical Capabilities**  RNNs are theoretically Turing\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "TechxGenus/Codestral-22B-v0.1-GPTQ", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
