Indeed, one description of\nstatistics is that it provides a means of transferring knowledge about a\nsample of a population to the whole population, and to other related\npopulations, which is not necessarily the same as prediction over time.\nWhen information is transferred across time, often to specific points in\ntime, the process is known as forecasting.\n\nClassification[edit]\n\nAssigning time series pattern to a specific category, for example\nidentify a word based on series of hand movements in sign language.\n\nSignal estimation[edit]\n\nThis approach is based on harmonic analysis and filtering of signals in\nthe frequency domain using the Fourier transform, and spectral density\nestimation, the development of which was significantly accelerated\nduring World War II by mathematician Norbert Wiener, electrical\nengineers Rudolf E. K\u00e1lm\u00e1n, Dennis Gabor and others for filtering\nsignals from noise and predicting signal values at a certain point in\ntime. See Kalman filter, Estimation theory, and Digital signal\nprocessing\n\nSegmentation[edit]\n\nSplitting a time-series into a sequence of segments. It is often the\ncase that a time-series can be represented as a sequence of individual\nsegments, each with its own characteristic properties. For example, the\naudio signal from a conference call can be partitioned into pieces\ncorresponding to the times during which each person was speaking. In\ntime-series segmentation, the goal is to identify the segment boundary\npoints in the time\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "TechxGenus/Codestral-22B-v0.1-GPTQ", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
