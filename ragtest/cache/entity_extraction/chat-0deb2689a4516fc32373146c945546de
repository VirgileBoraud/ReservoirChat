These methods ensure that sequences with varying dimensions can be processed uniformly by the model. \nQuestion: What is the function linspace() in the line : \u00ab X = np.array([[np.sin(np.linspace(0, 12*np.pi, 1000)) \u00bb or \u00ab Y = np.array([[np.sin(np.linspace(0, 12*np.pi, 1000)) \u00bb?\nAnswer: The function `linspace()` generates an array of 1000 evenly spaced values between `0` and `12\u03c0`.
