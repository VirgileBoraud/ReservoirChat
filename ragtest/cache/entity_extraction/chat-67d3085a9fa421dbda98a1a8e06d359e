Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

See also Markov switching\nmultifractal (MSMF) techniques for modeling volatility evolution.\n\nA hidden Markov model (HMM) is a statistical Markov model in which the\nsystem being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with unobserved\n(hidden) states. An HMM can be considered as the simplest dynamic\nBayesian network. HMM models are widely used in speech recognition, for\ntranslating a time series of spoken words into text.\n\nMany of these models are collected in the python package sktime.\n\nNotation[edit]\n\nA number of different notations are in use for time-series analysis. A\ncommon notation specifying a time series X that is indexed by the\nnatural numbers is written\n\nAnother common notation is\n\nwhere T is the index set.\n\nConditions[edit]\n\nThere are two sets of conditions under which much of the theory is\nbuilt:\n\nErgodicity implies stationarity, but the converse is not necessarily the\ncase.
