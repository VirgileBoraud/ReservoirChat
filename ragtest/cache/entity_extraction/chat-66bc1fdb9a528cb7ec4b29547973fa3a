It creates a copy of the receiver holding a reference to the sender.  - **`<<=` Operator:** This in-place operator also establishes a feedback connection but without creating a copy of the receiver node. The receiver node directly holds the reference to the sender node's state. \nQuestion: Why does having acces to the readout's last activation important?\nAnswer: Having access to the readout's last activation is important because it allows the reservoir to use the most recent output information for current processing. This feedback mechanism helps the network to remember and incorporate past decisions or predictions, which is crucial for tasks requiring temporal dependencies and continuity, such as time series forecasting, speech recognition, and control systems. By leveraging previous outputs, the network can improve its accuracy and performance in predicting future states or making informed decisions. \nQuestion: Why is there no difference of value between the .feedback() and the .state() in the line : \u00ab print(\"Feedback received (reservoir):\", reservoir.feedback()) \u00bb and the line \u00ab print(\"State sent: (readout):\", readout.state()) \u00bb?\nAnswer: There is no difference between the `.feedback()` and the `.state()` methods in this context because the feedback mechanism is designed to provide the reservoir with the most recent state of the readout.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "TechxGenus/Codestral-22B-v0.1-GPTQ", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
