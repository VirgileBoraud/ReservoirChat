It often implies that he dataset is available in it's entirety. The training involves the personal computer often requiring signifiant memory and processing power  Online Training updates the model incrementally as new data arrives. It then allows the model to learn and adapt in real-time. It is suitable for dynamic environments where data continuously changes. It is also less memory-intensive. \nQuestion: What does the .ravel() function do in the line : \u00ab ax.bar(np.arange(Wout.size), Wout.ravel()[::-1]) \u00bb?\nAnswer: It flattens the 'Wout' array into one-dimensional array. Indeed the 'Wout' array is a multi-dimensional array and 'ax.bar' expect a one-dimensional sequence. \nQuestion: What does np.r_[] do in the line : \u00ab Wout = np.r_[bias, Wout] \u00bb?\nAnswer: It is a shorthand for 'np.concatenate'. It then concatenates the 'bias' and 'Wout' arrays along the first axis. \nQuestion: What is the bias ?\nAnswer: It is a constant value added to the input of a neuron before the activation function to help the model make more accurate predictions. It allows the neuron to output a value even when the input\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "TechxGenus/Codestral-22B-v0.1-GPTQ", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
