{"result": " Parallelization is the process of distributing a computational task across multiple processors or cores to speed up computation and reduce overall processing time. This involves dividing a task into smaller sub-tasks that can be executed simultaneously on multiple processors or cores to improve performance and efficiency. Parallelization refers to the distribution of computational tasks across multiple processors or cores to speed up computation and reduce overall processing time, and it also encompasses the process of running multiple tasks simultaneously to speed up computation.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
