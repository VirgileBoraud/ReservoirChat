{"result": " Working Memory and Short-Term Memory are both concepts in the field of cognitive psychology that refer to different aspects of memory. Working Memory is a network that temporarily stores a sequence of events, while it is also described as a system that temporarily holds information that is later transferred to Short-Term Memory for immediate use. In essence, Working Memory acts as a bridge between Short-Term Memory and other cognitive processes, allowing for the manipulation and retention of information over a short period of time.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
