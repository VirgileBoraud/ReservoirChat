{"result": " A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network that processes sequences of inputs using internal state. This allows information to flow bidirectionally between its layers, making it suitable for tasks such as handwriting recognition and speech recognition. RNNs are characterized by connections that form a directed cycle, enabling past information to be used in processing future inputs. Additionally, RNNs are capable of returning a collection of predictions while updating a hidden state at each time step.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
