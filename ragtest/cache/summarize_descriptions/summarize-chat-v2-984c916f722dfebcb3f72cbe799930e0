{"result": " \"Input Scaling\" is a parameter used in Reservoir Computing, a field that involves the use of artificial neural networks. This parameter is employed to adjust the influence of each variable in a multivariate time-series, as well as to adjust the strength of the input signal to the reservoir. In essence, Input Scaling plays a crucial role in modulating the impact of the input data on the reservoir's dynamics.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
