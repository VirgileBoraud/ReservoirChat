{"result": " Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of artificial neural network that are characterized by their ability to allow the output from some nodes to affect subsequent input to the same nodes, creating a bi-directional flow of information. This feature makes RNNs suitable for tasks such as speech recognition, where they can utilize their internal state to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. Additionally, RNNs are dynamic and have been used in various applications, including time series prediction and pattern recognition.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
