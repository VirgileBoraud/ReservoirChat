{"result": " LSTM, or Long Short-Term Memory, is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that has been developed to address the vanishing gradient problem. LSTM networks are known for their ability to handle long delays between significant events and to mix low and high-frequency components. They are characterized by their unique architecture, which includes a gating mechanism that selectively forgets or remembers information. LSTM networks have been widely used in various machine learning models, including those developed by Google. Invented by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in 1997, LSTM networks are a type of neural network that uses a mechanism to retain information over long sequences.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
