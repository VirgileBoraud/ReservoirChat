{"result": " Overfitting is a common issue in machine learning that arises when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and irrelevant details. This can lead to poor generalization on new data, as the model may perform well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and irrelevant details, which can result in poor performance on new data. In essence, overfitting is a problem that occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and irrelevant details, leading to poor generalization on new data.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
