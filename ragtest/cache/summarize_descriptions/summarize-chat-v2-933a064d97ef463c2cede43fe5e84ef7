{"result": " Real-Time Recurrent Learning is a learning algorithm for Recurrent Neural Networks that operates in real-time. It is a method developed for training recurrent neural networks and a supervised training algorithm for RNNs that adapts all connections using gradient descent, known since the early 1990s. This algorithm allows for the training of recurrent neural networks in real-time, making it a valuable tool for applications that require continuous learning and adaptation.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
