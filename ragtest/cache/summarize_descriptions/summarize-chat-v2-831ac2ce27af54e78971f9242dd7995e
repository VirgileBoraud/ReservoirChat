{"result": " IndRNN, also known as independently recurrent neural network, is a variant of RNN that focuses on reducing the context of a neuron to its own past state. This allows for the exploration of cross-neuron information in following layers. Additionally, IndRNN is designed to learn memories of different ranges by reducing the context of a neuron to its own past state.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
