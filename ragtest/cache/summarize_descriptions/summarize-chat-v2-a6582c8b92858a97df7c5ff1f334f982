{"result": " Online Learning is a method in Machine Learning that involves the incremental updating of a model with new data as it becomes available. This process allows for real-time adaptation and continuous improvement of the model. It is characterized by the updating of the parameters of a model incrementally with each new sample of data, enabling the model to adapt and improve over time.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
