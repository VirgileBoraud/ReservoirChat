{"result": " \"RIDGE and ESN are related entities. ESN, which stands for Echo State Network, is composed of a Ridge component for readout and training. Ridge is a regularization technique used in ESN to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. In the context of ESN, Ridge is also used as a type of readout for time series prediction and in conjunction with ESN for processing sequences of inputs and targets. Additionally, Ridge is used as a regularization technique in the Echo State Network for regression tasks.
