{"result": " A Node in the context provided is a recurrent operator that can carry parameters and has a defined function for mapping internal state and input vector to the next state. Additionally, it is represented as a class in reservoirpy, which allows for high-level object-oriented API. In other words, a Node is a unit in a network that can be used for various purposes, including custom training and inference policies, due to its role as a class in reservoirpy.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
