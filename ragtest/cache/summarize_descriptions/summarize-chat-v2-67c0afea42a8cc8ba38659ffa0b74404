{"result": " Delta Coefficients are a key feature in the field of audio and speech processing. They are derived from the MFCCs (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) and are used to capture the temporal dynamics of these coefficients. Delta Coefficients are also known as a measure of the rate of change of a signal, which makes them useful in audio and music analysis. Essentially, Delta Coefficients are the first-order differences of the MFCCs, and they enhance the feature set for tasks such as audio and speech processing by adding information about the rate of change of the MFCCs over time.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
