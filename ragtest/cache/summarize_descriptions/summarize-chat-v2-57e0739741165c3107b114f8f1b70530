{"result": " \"Cell (v_i) and Input (I_i) are interconnected in a network. The cell (v_i) is designed to maintain sensitivity to its input size (I_i), which means that an increase in the size of Input (I_i) leads to an enhanced sensitivity of the cell. Additionally, each cell in the network is programmed to maintain sensitivity to the relative size of its inputs, ensuring a balanced response to varying input sizes.\"", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
