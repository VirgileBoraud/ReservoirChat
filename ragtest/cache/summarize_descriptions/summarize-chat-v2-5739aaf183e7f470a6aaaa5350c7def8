{"result": " The MOTIVATOR Model is a brain mechanism model that has been developed from the Cognitive-Emotional-Motor (CogEM) Theory. This model emphasizes the role of valued goals in learning and attention, focusing on the learning of relevant events while blocking irrelevant ones during reinforcement learning and motivated attention. In essence, the MOTIVATOR Model is a comprehensive framework that combines the insights from the CogEM Theory with a focus on goal-directed learning and attention.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
