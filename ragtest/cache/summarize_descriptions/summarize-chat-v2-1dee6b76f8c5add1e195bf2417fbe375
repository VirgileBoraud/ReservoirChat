{"result": " Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Feedback Neural Networks (FNNs) are closely related entities. Both types of neural networks incorporate time delays or feedback loops, which is a common characteristic. RNNs are specifically classified as Feedback Neural Networks due to their use of these mechanisms. FNNs, on the other hand, are neural networks that incorporate time delays or feedback loops, similar to RNNs, but replacing standard storage mechanisms. This shows that there is an overlap in the concepts of RNNs and FNNs, with both types of networks utilizing feedback loops and time delays for their functionality.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
