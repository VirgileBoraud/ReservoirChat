{"result": " Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that incorporates controlled storage mechanisms, known as gated states or gated memory. LSTMs are designed to address the vanishing gradient problem and better capture long-term dependencies in sequential data by using gated states or gated memory. This allows LSTMs to effectively learn and remember information over longer sequences compared to traditional RNNs.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
