{"result": " Ridge Regularization is a technique used in machine learning models to prevent overfitting. It is mentioned in the text in the context of the Ridge Readout, and it works by adding a penalty term to the loss function. Additionally, the Ridge Regularization is a fixed parameter with a log-uniform distribution between 1e-8 and 1e1.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
