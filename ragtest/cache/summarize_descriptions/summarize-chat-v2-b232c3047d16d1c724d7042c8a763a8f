{"result": " The Cepstral Domain is a signal processing technique that is used to analyze signals. This technique focuses on highlighting periodic structures in the frequency domain, which is achieved by taking the inverse Fourier transform of the logarithm of the signal's spectrum. In essence, the Cepstral Domain provides a representation of a signal that emphasizes its periodic components.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
