{"result": " Command Cells are neural structures found in invertebrates that control stereotyped behaviors, such as the rhythmic beating of crayfish swimmerets. They are also mentioned in the text as a component of the Avalanche system, where they play a role in determining which ritualistic behavior the system will activate. Additionally, Command Cells are neurons that are necessary for the Avalanche circuit to respond to environmental feedback. In summary, Command Cells are neural structures that control stereotyped behaviors in invertebrates and are involved in the activation of ritualistic behaviors within the Avalanche system.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
