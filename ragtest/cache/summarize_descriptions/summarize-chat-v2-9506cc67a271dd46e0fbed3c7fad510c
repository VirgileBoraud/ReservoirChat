{"result": " Long-term forecasting is a method that involves predicting future values of a timeseries over an extended period. This technique involves using a trained model to make predictions beyond the immediate next data point. It is a process that aims to provide a sequence of future values, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying patterns and trends in the data.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
