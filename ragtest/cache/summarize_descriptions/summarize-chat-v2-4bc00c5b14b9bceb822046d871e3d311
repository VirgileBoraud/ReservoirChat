{"result": " Working Memory is a cognitive system that temporarily stores and manipulates information. This system has a limited capacity and activity redistribution when new items are stored. It is responsible for holding and processing information needed for immediate use in cognitive tasks. The model developed by Grossberg (1978a, 1978b) further explains the storage and retrieval of items in short-term memory, taking into account factors such as activity levels and noise. In summary, Working Memory is a limited capacity system in the brain that holds and manipulates information for immediate use, with consideration for activity levels and noise in information processing.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
