{"result": " NRMSE, also known as the Normalized Root Mean Square Error, is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a model. It measures the differences between predicted values and actual values, normalized by the range or mean of the actual values. This dimensionless measure provides a standardized way to compare the accuracy of different models. NRMSE is mentioned in the provided code as well, further emphasizing its importance in the context.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
