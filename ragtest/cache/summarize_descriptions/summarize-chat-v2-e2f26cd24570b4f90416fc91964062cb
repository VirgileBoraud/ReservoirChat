{"result": " MEL-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are a feature extraction technique used in audio and speech processing. They are employed to represent the short-term power spectrum of a signal and to capture the spectral properties of the audio signal. This technique is widely used in audio signal processing to extract meaningful features from audio signals.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
