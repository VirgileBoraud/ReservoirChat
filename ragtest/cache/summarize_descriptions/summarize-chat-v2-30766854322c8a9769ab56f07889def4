{"result": " \"Signal Velocity\" is a term that refers to the speed at which signals are transmitted through axons. It specifically denotes the speed at which signals propagate along axons, and it is important to note that this speed should be proportional to the length of the axons. In other words, the velocity of signal transmission is influenced by the length of the axons, and unbiased learning is assumed to follow this proportional relationship.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
