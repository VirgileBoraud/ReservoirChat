{"result": " Artificial Soft Limbs are a type of non-digital computational substrate that have been used in conjunction with Echo State Networks. They are also known as non-digital computer substrates and are used as a reservoir in ESNs. Additionally, Artificial Soft Limbs are objects that can be used as a nonlinear reservoir. In summary, Artificial Soft Limbs are a versatile type of non-digital computational substrate that have been used in the context of Echo State Networks, serving as reservoirs and nonlinear reservoirs.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
