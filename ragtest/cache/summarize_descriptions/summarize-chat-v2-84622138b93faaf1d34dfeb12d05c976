{"result": " Teacher Forcing is a training technique used in sequence modeling where the model is provided with the correct input at each time step during training. This technique is also known as a technique used during the generation of system states, where correct outputs are written into the output units. Essentially, Teacher Forcing involves feeding true output values as inputs to the network during training to help the model learn the sequence more accurately.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
