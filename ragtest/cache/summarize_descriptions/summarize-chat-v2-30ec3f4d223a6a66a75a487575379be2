{"result": " Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of Recurrent Neural Network that is designed to retain information over long sequences. It is known for addressing the vanishing gradient problem, which is a common challenge in training traditional recurrent neural networks. LSTM uses a mechanism that allows it to store and process information over long sequences. Additionally, LSTM is an example of second-order RNNs, which means it uses higher order weights and states to create a direct mapping to a finite-state machine.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
