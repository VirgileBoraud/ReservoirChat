{"result": " \"RSQUARE\" is a metric used in the field of machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model. It is also a statistical measure that indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable(s). In other words, RSQUARE helps to determine the goodness of fit of a model and its ability to predict outcomes.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
