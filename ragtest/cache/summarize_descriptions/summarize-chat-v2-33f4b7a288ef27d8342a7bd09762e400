{"result": " Multivariate Time-Series Models are statistical models that are extensions of ARIMA and ARFIMA models. These models are designed to handle vector-valued data, making them suitable for analyzing multiple time-series variables simultaneously. They extend univariate models to accommodate the complexities of multivariate data, allowing for more comprehensive and accurate analysis.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
