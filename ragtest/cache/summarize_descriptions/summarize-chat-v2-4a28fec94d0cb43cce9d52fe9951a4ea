{"result": " Mechanical Nanooscillators are a type of non-digital computer substrate that can be used as a reservoir in ESNs. Additionally, they are objects used as a nonlinear reservoir. In summary, Mechanical Nanooscillators are versatile components that can serve as a reservoir in ESNs and as a nonlinear reservoir in various applications.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
