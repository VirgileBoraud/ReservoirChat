{"result": " The \"ON-CENTER OFF-SURROUND NETWORK\" is a type of network that obeys the membrane or shunting equations of neurophysiology. This network design is characterized by its ability to enable neurons to retain sensitivity to the relative sizes of their inputs across the network, which contributes to its ubiquity in the brain. This network design helps explain its presence and function in the brain.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
