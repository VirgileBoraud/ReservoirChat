It explains how the brain autonomously learns to categorize, recognize, and predict objects and events in a changing world. The theory is mentioned in the text as a related concept to MTM. ART is a neural network model that focuses on the role of attention in learning and recognition. It was introduced to propose how top-down learned expectations and attentional focusing could dynamically stabilize learning in a Competitive Learning or Self-Organizing Map model. In essence, Adaptive Resonance Theory is a learning model that aims to stabilize learning in response to input patterns by incorporating the role of attention.\",8\n387,\"\"\"BAM\"\"\",\" \"\"BAM\"\" is a type of model that applies to learning laws, such as the passive decay associative law and the signal Hebb law. Additionally, BAM is mentioned as an organization that was inspired by Adaptive Resonance Theory.

It is described as a rule that assumes working memory has a limited capacity, and when new items are stored, activity is redistributed rather than simply added. This principle is also mentioned in relation to RCFs (Regularity, Contiguity, and Frequency), suggesting that it follows from the tendency of these frameworks to normalize total network activity. Additionally, the Normalization Rule is presented as a conservation law that ensures the total activity remains constant by forcing a decrease in other activities when one activity increases. Furthermore, it is characterized as a constraint that ensures stable learning and memory of list chunks, likely through a specialized process. In essence, the Normalization Rule is a principle that ensures the total activity of the working memory network has a maximum capacity, redistributing activity when new items are stored.\",6\n399,\"\"\"LTM INVARIANCE PRINCIPLE\"\"\",\" The LTM Invariance Principle is a postulate that plays a significant role in understanding stable learning and memory of list chunks. According to the descriptions provided, this principle ensures that learning and memory of list chunks remain stable without causing catastrophic forgetting of familiar subset list chunks. Additionally, it is suggested that all working memories are specialized versions of the same underlying network design, further emphasizing its importance in maintaining stable learning and memory.\",3\n228,\"\"\"RCFS\"\"\",\" \"\"RCFs, or Recurrent Cortical Feedbacks, are a type of model or theory that has been studied in various contexts, including the explanation of visual perception and decision-making. They are also mentioned as a network model that behaves like an Item-and-Order working memory model under certain conditions. Additionally, RCFs are likely a type of specialized process potentially related to the Normalization Rule. Despite not having a explicitly defined nature, they are known to refer to recurrent cortical feedbacks, which are studied in the context of cortical models. Furthermore, RCFs, or Recurrent Connections with Feedback, are a type of network that help to store inputs in short-term memory and obey the LTM Invariance Principle.\"\"\n\nThe summary provides a comprehensive description of RCFs, including their role as a model or theory for explaining visual perception and decision-making, their behavior as a network model, their potential relationship to the Normalization Rule, and their role in cortical models and short-term memory storage. The description also clarifies that RCFs are known as recurrent cortical feedbacks.\",5\n227,\"\"\"CORTICAL MODELS\"\"\",\"\"\"Cortical Models are theoretical representations of the brain's cortex, used for studying shunting dynamics.\"\"\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\n475,\"\"\"GROSSBERG\"\"\",\"\"\"NORMALIZATION RULE\"\"\",\"\"\"Grossberg predicted the Normalization Rule to support stable learning and memory of list chunks.\"\"\",75\n474,\"\"\"GROSSBERG\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM INVARIANCE PRINCIPLE\"\"\",\"\"\"Grossberg predicted the LTM Invariance Principle to ensure stable learning and memory of list chunks.\"\"\",72\n643,\"\"\"NORMALIZATION RULE\"\"\",\"\"\"WORKING MEMORY\"\"\",\"\"\"The Normalization Rule is a principle that applies to working memories, ensuring their limited capacity and activity redistribution when new items are stored.\"\"\",15\n652,\"\"\"WORKING MEMORY\"\"\",\"\"\"RCFS\"\"\",\"\"\"RCFs are mentioned as a type of network that can be embodied by specialized recurrent on-center off-surround shunting networks, which are related to the functioning of working memories.\"\"\",14\n642,\"\"\"NORMALIZATION RULE\"\"\",\"\"\"RCFS\"\"\",\" The Normalization Rule and RCFS are both mentioned in the context of network activity.

These principles are predicted to support stable learning and memory of list chunks. The LTM Invariance Principle and the Normalization Rule are two interconnected constraints that Grossberg has proposed to ensure the stability of learning and memory processes.

It interacts with STM (Short-Term Memory) during this process. LTM is also a component of the Generalized Additive RNNs architecture, where it receives axons from other cells and learns spatial patterns. LTM is a type of long-term memory system that changes at a slower rate than STM. It enables information to be fluently recalled at a future time, making it an essential component for long-term retention and retrieval of information. LTM is a theoretical concept that biases working memory toward more primacy dominance. In the context of neural networks, LTM is a component that stores and retrieves information over an extended period, storing learned patterns and activities. Overall, LTM is a versatile and important component in the field of neuronal learning and memory storage.\",9\n433,\"\"\"WM\"\"\",\"\"\"WM refers to Working Memory, a cognitive system that holds information temporarily for immediate use.\"\"\",2\n128,\"\"\"HEBB\"\"\",\" Donald O. Hebb, a renowned neuroscientist, is a person who ascribed the property of monotonely increasing learned weights to his law in the 1940s.

LTM traces learn to match the pattern of activities, or STM traces, of cells across the network. Both STM and LTM are mentioned in relation to uncoupled interactions in learning models, suggesting a potential separation between the two types of memory. However, the text also suggests a relationship or connection between the two components of the neural network, as they are mentioned together and interact with each other during Neuronal Learning, allowing the learning of spatial patterns. Additionally, STM includes LTM as a type of memory system, which changes at a slower rate than STM. In summary, STM and LTM are two components of the neural network that have distinct roles and functions, but they also have a relationship or connection with each other, as they interact during learning and STM includes LTM as a type of memory system.\",29\n513,\"\"\"STM\"\"\",\"\"\"WM\"\"\",\"\"\"WM is composed of Short-Term Memory, which stores information temporarily for immediate use.\"\"\",22\n515,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"LEABRA MODEL\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM is a component used in the Leabra model, which stores and retrieves information over an extended period.\"\"\",14\n516,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"THE BRAIN\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM is mentioned as a component of the brain that enables it to store and retrieve learned information.\"\"\",14\n517,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"NEURONAL LEARNING\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM is a component involved in the process of Neuronal Learning.\"\"\",12\n518,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"GENERALIZED ADDITIVE RNNS\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM is a component of the Generalized Additive RNNs architecture that receives axons from other cells.\"\"\",12\n520,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"TMS\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM is mentioned as a factor that biases working memory toward more primacy dominance, which may influence the comparison between the TMS and the IMS.\"\"\",12\n519,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"WM\"\"\",\"\"\"WM also interacts with Long-Term Memory, which stores information for long-term retention and retrieval.\"\"\",11\n492,\"\"\"ROSENBLATT\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"Rosenblatt's work introduced equations to change the weights in a learning model, which are referred to as LTM traces.\"\"\",11\n514,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"HEBB\"\"\",\"\"\"Hebb's learning postulate assumes the wrong processing unit; it is not the strength of an individual connection, but a distributed pattern of LTM traces.\"\"\",10\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.

This theory suggests how a series of Outstars can learn an arbitrary spatiotemporal pattern. Additionally, it has been mentioned that the Outstar Learning Theorem is a specific case of the Generalized Additive Model. This means that the theory can be understood within the broader context of the Generalized Additive Model, and it adds to the understanding of this model by focusing on a specific application.\",4\n345,\"\"\"SPATIAL PATTERN LEARNING\"\"\",\" Spatial Pattern Learning is a concept that encompasses the ability of certain anatomies to learn patterns.

It is a component of the Generalized Additive RNNs architecture, where it sends axons to other cells and learns spatial patterns. Additionally, it is described as a storage mechanism used to store patterns in signals, a type of memory that stores and updates patterns based on input, and a system that can trigger learning and enable fluently recalled information at a future time. STM is also an abbreviation used to refer to Short-Term Memory, a component that stores input patterns persistently and temporarily stores and processes information. In the context of neural learning, STM is a component that interacts with LTM to store partially contrast-enhanced patterns. Overall, STM is a concept that refers to a short-term memory system used for storing and processing information temporarily for immediate use.\",20\n197,\"\"\"BRNN\"\"\",\" \"\"BRNN\"\" is mentioned in the text and is commonly referred to as a Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network.

However, the text also suggests a relationship or connection between the two components of the neural network, as they are mentioned together and interact with each other during Neuronal Learning, allowing the learning of spatial patterns. Additionally, STM includes LTM as a type of memory system, which changes at a slower rate than STM.

It is often mistakenly referred to as the Hopfield network, but it is actually a component of the Liapunov function proposed by Cohen and Grossberg. The Additive Model is also known as a variant of the STM Equation, with specific parameters set to 0. It is primarily used as an approximation of the Shunting Model when inputs are small and do not approach saturation values. Additionally, the Additive Model is a neural network concept mentioned in the text, developed by Grossberg, and it has been used in various computational analyses and research areas. It is also used to explain associative learning of temporal order information in serial learning paradigms. Furthermore, the Additive Model is a probabilistic decision-making model that does not exhibit self-normalization properties, and it is included in the Cohen-Grossberg Model systems. In summary, the Additive Model is a complex mathematical concept with various applications in computational analyses and research, often mistakenly associated with the Hopfield network. It is a model used to approximate the Shunting Model and explain associative learning of temporal order information, and it is also a neural network concept developed by Grossberg.\",17\n81,\"\"\"MAIN TERM\"\"\",\"\"\"The Main Term is a component of the Additive Model, representing the primary term in the equation.\"\"\",1\n82,\"\"\"POSITIVE FEEDBACK TERM\"\"\",\"\"\"The Positive Feedback Term is a component of the Additive Model, representing the influence of positive feedback on the system.\"\"\",1\n83,\"\"\"NEGATIVE FEEDBACK TERM\"\"\",\"\"\"The Negative Feedback Term is a component of the Additive Model, representing the influence of negative feedback on the system.\"\"\",1\n84,\"\"\"INPUT TERM\"\"\",\"\"\"The Input Term is a component of the Additive Model, representing external inputs to the system.\"\"\",1\n89,\"\"\"COMPUTATIONAL VISION\"\"\",\"\"\"Computational Vision is an application area where the Additive Model has been used for analysis and recognition.\"\"\",1\n90,\"\"\"LEARNING\"\"\",\"\"\"Learning is an application area where the Additive Model has been used for analysis and decision-making.\"\"\",1\n91,\"\"\"SPEECH AND LANGUAGE ANALYSIS\"\"\",\"\"\"Speech and Language Analysis is an application area where the Additive Model has been used for analysis of temporal order.\"\"\",1\n92,\"\"\"SENSORY-MOTOR CONTROL\"\"\", Sensory-Motor Control is an application area where the Additive Model has been used for analysis and control.

However, it's important to note that there has been a misnomer in the literature, as the Additive Model has not been accurately referred to as the Hopfield network. Instead, the Hopfield network is a different model developed by John Hopfield, which is characterized by its use of a different approach compared to the Additive Model.

It is primarily used for reproducing certain time series and is also employed for time series prediction and analysis.

It explains how the brain autonomously learns to categorize, recognize, and predict objects and events in a changing world. The theory is mentioned in the text as a related concept to MTM. ART is a neural network model that focuses on the role of attention in learning and recognition. It was introduced to propose how top-down learned expectations and attentional focusing could dynamically stabilize learning in a Competitive Learning or Self-Organizing Map model. In essence, Adaptive Resonance Theory is a learning model that aims to stabilize learning in response to input patterns by incorporating the role of attention.\",8\n387,\"\"\"BAM\"\"\",\" \"\"BAM\"\" is a type of model that applies to learning laws, such as the passive decay associative law and the signal Hebb law. Additionally, BAM is mentioned as an organization that was inspired by Adaptive Resonance Theory.

It is described as a rule that assumes working memory has a limited capacity, and when new items are stored, activity is redistributed rather than simply added. This principle is also mentioned in relation to RCFs (Regularity, Contiguity, and Frequency), suggesting that it follows from the tendency of these frameworks to normalize total network activity. Additionally, the Normalization Rule is presented as a conservation law that ensures the total activity remains constant by forcing a decrease in other activities when one activity increases. Furthermore, it is characterized as a constraint that ensures stable learning and memory of list chunks, likely through a specialized process. In essence, the Normalization Rule is a principle that ensures the total activity of the working memory network has a maximum capacity, redistributing activity when new items are stored.\",6\n399,\"\"\"LTM INVARIANCE PRINCIPLE\"\"\",\" The LTM Invariance Principle is a postulate that plays a significant role in understanding stable learning and memory of list chunks. According to the descriptions provided, this principle ensures that learning and memory of list chunks remain stable without causing catastrophic forgetting of familiar subset list chunks. Additionally, it is suggested that all working memories are specialized versions of the same underlying network design, further emphasizing its importance in maintaining stable learning and memory.\",3\n228,\"\"\"RCFS\"\"\",\" \"\"RCFs, or Recurrent Cortical Feedbacks, are a type of model or theory that has been studied in various contexts, including the explanation of visual perception and decision-making. They are also mentioned as a network model that behaves like an Item-and-Order working memory model under certain conditions. Additionally, RCFs are likely a type of specialized process potentially related to the Normalization Rule. Despite not having a explicitly defined nature, they are known to refer to recurrent cortical feedbacks, which are studied in the context of cortical models. Furthermore, RCFs, or Recurrent Connections with Feedback, are a type of network that help to store inputs in short-term memory and obey the LTM Invariance Principle.\"\"\n\nThe summary provides a comprehensive description of RCFs, including their role as a model or theory for explaining visual perception and decision-making, their behavior as a network model, their potential relationship to the Normalization Rule, and their role in cortical models and short-term memory storage. The description also clarifies that RCFs are known as recurrent cortical feedbacks.\",5\n227,\"\"\"CORTICAL MODELS\"\"\",\"\"\"Cortical Models are theoretical representations of the brain's cortex, used for studying shunting dynamics.\"\"\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\n475,\"\"\"GROSSBERG\"\"\",\"\"\"NORMALIZATION RULE\"\"\",\"\"\"Grossberg predicted the Normalization Rule to support stable learning and memory of list chunks.\"\"\",75\n474,\"\"\"GROSSBERG\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM INVARIANCE PRINCIPLE\"\"\",\"\"\"Grossberg predicted the LTM Invariance Principle to ensure stable learning and memory of list chunks.\"\"\",72\n643,\"\"\"NORMALIZATION RULE\"\"\",\"\"\"WORKING MEMORY\"\"\",\"\"\"The Normalization Rule is a principle that applies to working memories, ensuring their limited capacity and activity redistribution when new items are stored.\"\"\",15\n652,\"\"\"WORKING MEMORY\"\"\",\"\"\"RCFS\"\"\",\"\"\"RCFs are mentioned as a type of network that can be embodied by specialized recurrent on-center off-surround shunting networks, which are related to the functioning of working memories.\"\"\",14\n642,\"\"\"NORMALIZATION RULE\"\"\",\"\"\"RCFS\"\"\",\" The Normalization Rule and RCFS are both mentioned in the context of network activity.

These principles are predicted to support stable learning and memory of list chunks. The LTM Invariance Principle and the Normalization Rule are two interconnected constraints that Grossberg has proposed to ensure the stability of learning and memory processes.

It interacts with STM (Short-Term Memory) during this process. LTM is also a component of the Generalized Additive RNNs architecture, where it receives axons from other cells and learns spatial patterns. LTM is a type of long-term memory system that changes at a slower rate than STM. It enables information to be fluently recalled at a future time, making it an essential component for long-term retention and retrieval of information. LTM is a theoretical concept that biases working memory toward more primacy dominance. In the context of neural networks, LTM is a component that stores and retrieves information over an extended period, storing learned patterns and activities. Overall, LTM is a versatile and important component in the field of neuronal learning and memory storage.\",9\n433,\"\"\"WM\"\"\",\"\"\"WM refers to Working Memory, a cognitive system that holds information temporarily for immediate use.\"\"\",2\n128,\"\"\"HEBB\"\"\",\" Donald O. Hebb, a renowned neuroscientist, is a person who ascribed the property of monotonely increasing learned weights to his law in the 1940s.

LTM traces learn to match the pattern of activities, or STM traces, of cells across the network. Both STM and LTM are mentioned in relation to uncoupled interactions in learning models, suggesting a potential separation between the two types of memory. However, the text also suggests a relationship or connection between the two components of the neural network, as they are mentioned together and interact with each other during Neuronal Learning, allowing the learning of spatial patterns. Additionally, STM includes LTM as a type of memory system, which changes at a slower rate than STM. In summary, STM and LTM are two components of the neural network that have distinct roles and functions, but they also have a relationship or connection with each other, as they interact during learning and STM includes LTM as a type of memory system.\",29\n513,\"\"\"STM\"\"\",\"\"\"WM\"\"\",\"\"\"WM is composed of Short-Term Memory, which stores information temporarily for immediate use.\"\"\",22\n515,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"LEABRA MODEL\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM is a component used in the Leabra model, which stores and retrieves information over an extended period.\"\"\",14\n516,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"THE BRAIN\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM is mentioned as a component of the brain that enables it to store and retrieve learned information.\"\"\",14\n517,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"NEURONAL LEARNING\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM is a component involved in the process of Neuronal Learning.\"\"\",12\n518,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"GENERALIZED ADDITIVE RNNS\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM is a component of the Generalized Additive RNNs architecture that receives axons from other cells.\"\"\",12\n520,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"TMS\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM is mentioned as a factor that biases working memory toward more primacy dominance, which may influence the comparison between the TMS and the IMS.\"\"\",12\n519,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"WM\"\"\",\"\"\"WM also interacts with Long-Term Memory, which stores information for long-term retention and retrieval.\"\"\",11\n492,\"\"\"ROSENBLATT\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"Rosenblatt's work introduced equations to change the weights in a learning model, which are referred to as LTM traces.\"\"\",11\n514,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"HEBB\"\"\",\"\"\"Hebb's learning postulate assumes the wrong processing unit; it is not the strength of an individual connection, but a distributed pattern of LTM traces.\"\"\",10\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.

This theory suggests how a series of Outstars can learn an arbitrary spatiotemporal pattern. Additionally, it has been mentioned that the Outstar Learning Theorem is a specific case of the Generalized Additive Model. This means that the theory can be understood within the broader context of the Generalized Additive Model, and it adds to the understanding of this model by focusing on a specific application.\",4\n345,\"\"\"SPATIAL PATTERN LEARNING\"\"\",\" Spatial Pattern Learning is a concept that encompasses the ability of certain anatomies to learn patterns.

It is a component of the Generalized Additive RNNs architecture, where it sends axons to other cells and learns spatial patterns. Additionally, it is described as a storage mechanism used to store patterns in signals, a type of memory that stores and updates patterns based on input, and a system that can trigger learning and enable fluently recalled information at a future time. STM is also an abbreviation used to refer to Short-Term Memory, a component that stores input patterns persistently and temporarily stores and processes information. In the context of neural learning, STM is a component that interacts with LTM to store partially contrast-enhanced patterns. Overall, STM is a concept that refers to a short-term memory system used for storing and processing information temporarily for immediate use.\",20\n197,\"\"\"BRNN\"\"\",\" \"\"BRNN\"\" is mentioned in the text and is commonly referred to as a Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network.

However, the text also suggests a relationship or connection between the two components of the neural network, as they are mentioned together and interact with each other during Neuronal Learning, allowing the learning of spatial patterns. Additionally, STM includes LTM as a type of memory system, which changes at a slower rate than STM.

It is often mistakenly referred to as the Hopfield network, but it is actually a component of the Liapunov function proposed by Cohen and Grossberg. The Additive Model is also known as a variant of the STM Equation, with specific parameters set to 0. It is primarily used as an approximation of the Shunting Model when inputs are small and do not approach saturation values. Additionally, the Additive Model is a neural network concept mentioned in the text, developed by Grossberg, and it has been used in various computational analyses and research areas. It is also used to explain associative learning of temporal order information in serial learning paradigms. Furthermore, the Additive Model is a probabilistic decision-making model that does not exhibit self-normalization properties, and it is included in the Cohen-Grossberg Model systems. In summary, the Additive Model is a complex mathematical concept with various applications in computational analyses and research, often mistakenly associated with the Hopfield network. It is a model used to approximate the Shunting Model and explain associative learning of temporal order information, and it is also a neural network concept developed by Grossberg.\",17\n81,\"\"\"MAIN TERM\"\"\",\"\"\"The Main Term is a component of the Additive Model, representing the primary term in the equation.\"\"\",1\n82,\"\"\"POSITIVE FEEDBACK TERM\"\"\",\"\"\"The Positive Feedback Term is a component of the Additive Model, representing the influence of positive feedback on the system.\"\"\",1\n83,\"\"\"NEGATIVE FEEDBACK TERM\"\"\",\"\"\"The Negative Feedback Term is a component of the Additive Model, representing the influence of negative feedback on the system.\"\"\",1\n84,\"\"\"INPUT TERM\"\"\",\"\"\"The Input Term is a component of the Additive Model, representing external inputs to the system.\"\"\",1\n89,\"\"\"COMPUTATIONAL VISION\"\"\",\"\"\"Computational Vision is an application area where the Additive Model has been used for analysis and recognition.\"\"\",1\n90,\"\"\"LEARNING\"\"\",\"\"\"Learning is an application area where the Additive Model has been used for analysis and decision-making.\"\"\",1\n91,\"\"\"SPEECH AND LANGUAGE ANALYSIS\"\"\",\"\"\"Speech and Language Analysis is an application area where the Additive Model has been used for analysis of temporal order.\"\"\",1\n92,\"\"\"SENSORY-MOTOR CONTROL\"\"\", Sensory-Motor Control is an application area where the Additive Model has been used for analysis and control.

However, it's important to note that there has been a misnomer in the literature, as the Additive Model has not been accurately referred to as the Hopfield network. Instead, the Hopfield network is a different model developed by John Hopfield, which is characterized by its use of a different approach compared to the Additive Model.

It is primarily used for reproducing certain time series and is also employed for time series prediction and analysis.

It explains how the brain autonomously learns to categorize, recognize, and predict objects and events in a changing world. The theory is mentioned in the text as a related concept to MTM. ART is a neural network model that focuses on the role of attention in learning and recognition. It was introduced to propose how top-down learned expectations and attentional focusing could dynamically stabilize learning in a Competitive Learning or Self-Organizing Map model. In essence, Adaptive Resonance Theory is a learning model that aims to stabilize learning in response to input patterns by incorporating the role of attention.\",8\n387,\"\"\"BAM\"\"\",\" \"\"BAM\"\" is a type of model that applies to learning laws, such as the passive decay associative law and the signal Hebb law. Additionally, BAM is mentioned as an organization that was inspired by Adaptive Resonance Theory.

It is described as a rule that assumes working memory has a limited capacity, and when new items are stored, activity is redistributed rather than simply added. This principle is also mentioned in relation to RCFs (Regularity, Contiguity, and Frequency), suggesting that it follows from the tendency of these frameworks to normalize total network activity. Additionally, the Normalization Rule is presented as a conservation law that ensures the total activity remains constant by forcing a decrease in other activities when one activity increases. Furthermore, it is characterized as a constraint that ensures stable learning and memory of list chunks, likely through a specialized process. In essence, the Normalization Rule is a principle that ensures the total activity of the working memory network has a maximum capacity, redistributing activity when new items are stored.\",6\n399,\"\"\"LTM INVARIANCE PRINCIPLE\"\"\",\" The LTM Invariance Principle is a postulate that plays a significant role in understanding stable learning and memory of list chunks. According to the descriptions provided, this principle ensures that learning and memory of list chunks remain stable without causing catastrophic forgetting of familiar subset list chunks. Additionally, it is suggested that all working memories are specialized versions of the same underlying network design, further emphasizing its importance in maintaining stable learning and memory.\",3\n228,\"\"\"RCFS\"\"\",\" \"\"RCFs, or Recurrent Cortical Feedbacks, are a type of model or theory that has been studied in various contexts, including the explanation of visual perception and decision-making. They are also mentioned as a network model that behaves like an Item-and-Order working memory model under certain conditions. Additionally, RCFs are likely a type of specialized process potentially related to the Normalization Rule. Despite not having a explicitly defined nature, they are known to refer to recurrent cortical feedbacks, which are studied in the context of cortical models. Furthermore, RCFs, or Recurrent Connections with Feedback, are a type of network that help to store inputs in short-term memory and obey the LTM Invariance Principle.\"\"\n\nThe summary provides a comprehensive description of RCFs, including their role as a model or theory for explaining visual perception and decision-making, their behavior as a network model, their potential relationship to the Normalization Rule, and their role in cortical models and short-term memory storage. The description also clarifies that RCFs are known as recurrent cortical feedbacks.\",5\n227,\"\"\"CORTICAL MODELS\"\"\",\"\"\"Cortical Models are theoretical representations of the brain's cortex, used for studying shunting dynamics.\"\"\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\n475,\"\"\"GROSSBERG\"\"\",\"\"\"NORMALIZATION RULE\"\"\",\"\"\"Grossberg predicted the Normalization Rule to support stable learning and memory of list chunks.\"\"\",75\n474,\"\"\"GROSSBERG\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM INVARIANCE PRINCIPLE\"\"\",\"\"\"Grossberg predicted the LTM Invariance Principle to ensure stable learning and memory of list chunks.\"\"\",72\n643,\"\"\"NORMALIZATION RULE\"\"\",\"\"\"WORKING MEMORY\"\"\",\"\"\"The Normalization Rule is a principle that applies to working memories, ensuring their limited capacity and activity redistribution when new items are stored.\"\"\",15\n652,\"\"\"WORKING MEMORY\"\"\",\"\"\"RCFS\"\"\",\"\"\"RCFs are mentioned as a type of network that can be embodied by specialized recurrent on-center off-surround shunting networks, which are related to the functioning of working memories.\"\"\",14\n642,\"\"\"NORMALIZATION RULE\"\"\",\"\"\"RCFS\"\"\",\" The Normalization Rule and RCFS are both mentioned in the context of network activity.

These principles are predicted to support stable learning and memory of list chunks. The LTM Invariance Principle and the Normalization Rule are two interconnected constraints that Grossberg has proposed to ensure the stability of learning and memory processes.

It interacts with STM (Short-Term Memory) during this process. LTM is also a component of the Generalized Additive RNNs architecture, where it receives axons from other cells and learns spatial patterns. LTM is a type of long-term memory system that changes at a slower rate than STM. It enables information to be fluently recalled at a future time, making it an essential component for long-term retention and retrieval of information. LTM is a theoretical concept that biases working memory toward more primacy dominance. In the context of neural networks, LTM is a component that stores and retrieves information over an extended period, storing learned patterns and activities. Overall, LTM is a versatile and important component in the field of neuronal learning and memory storage.\",9\n433,\"\"\"WM\"\"\",\"\"\"WM refers to Working Memory, a cognitive system that holds information temporarily for immediate use.\"\"\",2\n128,\"\"\"HEBB\"\"\",\" Donald O. Hebb, a renowned neuroscientist, is a person who ascribed the property of monotonely increasing learned weights to his law in the 1940s.

LTM traces learn to match the pattern of activities, or STM traces, of cells across the network. Both STM and LTM are mentioned in relation to uncoupled interactions in learning models, suggesting a potential separation between the two types of memory. However, the text also suggests a relationship or connection between the two components of the neural network, as they are mentioned together and interact with each other during Neuronal Learning, allowing the learning of spatial patterns. Additionally, STM includes LTM as a type of memory system, which changes at a slower rate than STM. In summary, STM and LTM are two components of the neural network that have distinct roles and functions, but they also have a relationship or connection with each other, as they interact during learning and STM includes LTM as a type of memory system.\",29\n513,\"\"\"STM\"\"\",\"\"\"WM\"\"\",\"\"\"WM is composed of Short-Term Memory, which stores information temporarily for immediate use.\"\"\",22\n515,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"LEABRA MODEL\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM is a component used in the Leabra model, which stores and retrieves information over an extended period.\"\"\",14\n516,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"THE BRAIN\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM is mentioned as a component of the brain that enables it to store and retrieve learned information.\"\"\",14\n517,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"NEURONAL LEARNING\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM is a component involved in the process of Neuronal Learning.\"\"\",12\n518,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"GENERALIZED ADDITIVE RNNS\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM is a component of the Generalized Additive RNNs architecture that receives axons from other cells.\"\"\",12\n520,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"TMS\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM is mentioned as a factor that biases working memory toward more primacy dominance, which may influence the comparison between the TMS and the IMS.\"\"\",12\n519,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"WM\"\"\",\"\"\"WM also interacts with Long-Term Memory, which stores information for long-term retention and retrieval.\"\"\",11\n492,\"\"\"ROSENBLATT\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"Rosenblatt's work introduced equations to change the weights in a learning model, which are referred to as LTM traces.\"\"\",11\n514,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"HEBB\"\"\",\"\"\"Hebb's learning postulate assumes the wrong processing unit; it is not the strength of an individual connection, but a distributed pattern of LTM traces.\"\"\",10\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.

This theory suggests how a series of Outstars can learn an arbitrary spatiotemporal pattern. Additionally, it has been mentioned that the Outstar Learning Theorem is a specific case of the Generalized Additive Model. This means that the theory can be understood within the broader context of the Generalized Additive Model, and it adds to the understanding of this model by focusing on a specific application.\",4\n345,\"\"\"SPATIAL PATTERN LEARNING\"\"\",\" Spatial Pattern Learning is a concept that encompasses the ability of certain anatomies to learn patterns.

It is a component of the Generalized Additive RNNs architecture, where it sends axons to other cells and learns spatial patterns. Additionally, it is described as a storage mechanism used to store patterns in signals, a type of memory that stores and updates patterns based on input, and a system that can trigger learning and enable fluently recalled information at a future time. STM is also an abbreviation used to refer to Short-Term Memory, a component that stores input patterns persistently and temporarily stores and processes information. In the context of neural learning, STM is a component that interacts with LTM to store partially contrast-enhanced patterns. Overall, STM is a concept that refers to a short-term memory system used for storing and processing information temporarily for immediate use.\",20\n197,\"\"\"BRNN\"\"\",\" \"\"BRNN\"\" is mentioned in the text and is commonly referred to as a Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network.

However, the text also suggests a relationship or connection between the two components of the neural network, as they are mentioned together and interact with each other during Neuronal Learning, allowing the learning of spatial patterns. Additionally, STM includes LTM as a type of memory system, which changes at a slower rate than STM.

It is often mistakenly referred to as the Hopfield network, but it is actually a component of the Liapunov function proposed by Cohen and Grossberg. The Additive Model is also known as a variant of the STM Equation, with specific parameters set to 0. It is primarily used as an approximation of the Shunting Model when inputs are small and do not approach saturation values. Additionally, the Additive Model is a neural network concept mentioned in the text, developed by Grossberg, and it has been used in various computational analyses and research areas. It is also used to explain associative learning of temporal order information in serial learning paradigms. Furthermore, the Additive Model is a probabilistic decision-making model that does not exhibit self-normalization properties, and it is included in the Cohen-Grossberg Model systems. In summary, the Additive Model is a complex mathematical concept with various applications in computational analyses and research, often mistakenly associated with the Hopfield network. It is a model used to approximate the Shunting Model and explain associative learning of temporal order information, and it is also a neural network concept developed by Grossberg.\",17\n81,\"\"\"MAIN TERM\"\"\",\"\"\"The Main Term is a component of the Additive Model, representing the primary term in the equation.\"\"\",1\n82,\"\"\"POSITIVE FEEDBACK TERM\"\"\",\"\"\"The Positive Feedback Term is a component of the Additive Model, representing the influence of positive feedback on the system.\"\"\",1\n83,\"\"\"NEGATIVE FEEDBACK TERM\"\"\",\"\"\"The Negative Feedback Term is a component of the Additive Model, representing the influence of negative feedback on the system.\"\"\",1\n84,\"\"\"INPUT TERM\"\"\",\"\"\"The Input Term is a component of the Additive Model, representing external inputs to the system.\"\"\",1\n89,\"\"\"COMPUTATIONAL VISION\"\"\",\"\"\"Computational Vision is an application area where the Additive Model has been used for analysis and recognition.\"\"\",1\n90,\"\"\"LEARNING\"\"\",\"\"\"Learning is an application area where the Additive Model has been used for analysis and decision-making.\"\"\",1\n91,\"\"\"SPEECH AND LANGUAGE ANALYSIS\"\"\",\"\"\"Speech and Language Analysis is an application area where the Additive Model has been used for analysis of temporal order.\"\"\",1\n92,\"\"\"SENSORY-MOTOR CONTROL\"\"\", Sensory-Motor Control is an application area where the Additive Model has been used for analysis and control.

However, it's important to note that there has been a misnomer in the literature, as the Additive Model has not been accurately referred to as the Hopfield network. Instead, the Hopfield network is a different model developed by John Hopfield, which is characterized by its use of a different approach compared to the Additive Model.

It is primarily used for reproducing certain time series and is also employed for time series prediction and analysis.

It explains how the brain autonomously learns to categorize, recognize, and predict objects and events in a changing world. The theory is mentioned in the text as a related concept to MTM. ART is a neural network model that focuses on the role of attention in learning and recognition. It was introduced to propose how top-down learned expectations and attentional focusing could dynamically stabilize learning in a Competitive Learning or Self-Organizing Map model. In essence, Adaptive Resonance Theory is a learning model that aims to stabilize learning in response to input patterns by incorporating the role of attention.\",8\n387,\"\"\"BAM\"\"\",\" \"\"BAM\"\" is a type of model that applies to learning laws, such as the passive decay associative law and the signal Hebb law. Additionally, BAM is mentioned as an organization that was inspired by Adaptive Resonance Theory.

It is described as a rule that assumes working memory has a limited capacity, and when new items are stored, activity is redistributed rather than simply added. This principle is also mentioned in relation to RCFs (Regularity, Contiguity, and Frequency), suggesting that it follows from the tendency of these frameworks to normalize total network activity. Additionally, the Normalization Rule is presented as a conservation law that ensures the total activity remains constant by forcing a decrease in other activities when one activity increases. Furthermore, it is characterized as a constraint that ensures stable learning and memory of list chunks, likely through a specialized process. In essence, the Normalization Rule is a principle that ensures the total activity of the working memory network has a maximum capacity, redistributing activity when new items are stored.\",6\n399,\"\"\"LTM INVARIANCE PRINCIPLE\"\"\",\" The LTM Invariance Principle is a postulate that plays a significant role in understanding stable learning and memory of list chunks. According to the descriptions provided, this principle ensures that learning and memory of list chunks remain stable without causing catastrophic forgetting of familiar subset list chunks. Additionally, it is suggested that all working memories are specialized versions of the same underlying network design, further emphasizing its importance in maintaining stable learning and memory.\",3\n228,\"\"\"RCFS\"\"\",\" \"\"RCFs, or Recurrent Cortical Feedbacks, are a type of model or theory that has been studied in various contexts, including the explanation of visual perception and decision-making. They are also mentioned as a network model that behaves like an Item-and-Order working memory model under certain conditions. Additionally, RCFs are likely a type of specialized process potentially related to the Normalization Rule. Despite not having a explicitly defined nature, they are known to refer to recurrent cortical feedbacks, which are studied in the context of cortical models. Furthermore, RCFs, or Recurrent Connections with Feedback, are a type of network that help to store inputs in short-term memory and obey the LTM Invariance Principle.\"\"\n\nThe summary provides a comprehensive description of RCFs, including their role as a model or theory for explaining visual perception and decision-making, their behavior as a network model, their potential relationship to the Normalization Rule, and their role in cortical models and short-term memory storage. The description also clarifies that RCFs are known as recurrent cortical feedbacks.\",5\n227,\"\"\"CORTICAL MODELS\"\"\",\"\"\"Cortical Models are theoretical representations of the brain's cortex, used for studying shunting dynamics.\"\"\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\n475,\"\"\"GROSSBERG\"\"\",\"\"\"NORMALIZATION RULE\"\"\",\"\"\"Grossberg predicted the Normalization Rule to support stable learning and memory of list chunks.\"\"\",75\n474,\"\"\"GROSSBERG\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM INVARIANCE PRINCIPLE\"\"\",\"\"\"Grossberg predicted the LTM Invariance Principle to ensure stable learning and memory of list chunks.\"\"\",72\n643,\"\"\"NORMALIZATION RULE\"\"\",\"\"\"WORKING MEMORY\"\"\",\"\"\"The Normalization Rule is a principle that applies to working memories, ensuring their limited capacity and activity redistribution when new items are stored.\"\"\",15\n652,\"\"\"WORKING MEMORY\"\"\",\"\"\"RCFS\"\"\",\"\"\"RCFs are mentioned as a type of network that can be embodied by specialized recurrent on-center off-surround shunting networks, which are related to the functioning of working memories.\"\"\",14\n642,\"\"\"NORMALIZATION RULE\"\"\",\"\"\"RCFS\"\"\",\" The Normalization Rule and RCFS are both mentioned in the context of network activity.

These principles are predicted to support stable learning and memory of list chunks. The LTM Invariance Principle and the Normalization Rule are two interconnected constraints that Grossberg has proposed to ensure the stability of learning and memory processes.

It interacts with STM (Short-Term Memory) during this process. LTM is also a component of the Generalized Additive RNNs architecture, where it receives axons from other cells and learns spatial patterns. LTM is a type of long-term memory system that changes at a slower rate than STM. It enables information to be fluently recalled at a future time, making it an essential component for long-term retention and retrieval of information. LTM is a theoretical concept that biases working memory toward more primacy dominance. In the context of neural networks, LTM is a component that stores and retrieves information over an extended period, storing learned patterns and activities. Overall, LTM is a versatile and important component in the field of neuronal learning and memory storage.\",9\n433,\"\"\"WM\"\"\",\"\"\"WM refers to Working Memory, a cognitive system that holds information temporarily for immediate use.\"\"\",2\n128,\"\"\"HEBB\"\"\",\" Donald O. Hebb, a renowned neuroscientist, is a person who ascribed the property of monotonely increasing learned weights to his law in the 1940s.

LTM traces learn to match the pattern of activities, or STM traces, of cells across the network. Both STM and LTM are mentioned in relation to uncoupled interactions in learning models, suggesting a potential separation between the two types of memory. However, the text also suggests a relationship or connection between the two components of the neural network, as they are mentioned together and interact with each other during Neuronal Learning, allowing the learning of spatial patterns. Additionally, STM includes LTM as a type of memory system, which changes at a slower rate than STM. In summary, STM and LTM are two components of the neural network that have distinct roles and functions, but they also have a relationship or connection with each other, as they interact during learning and STM includes LTM as a type of memory system.\",29\n513,\"\"\"STM\"\"\",\"\"\"WM\"\"\",\"\"\"WM is composed of Short-Term Memory, which stores information temporarily for immediate use.\"\"\",22\n515,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"LEABRA MODEL\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM is a component used in the Leabra model, which stores and retrieves information over an extended period.\"\"\",14\n516,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"THE BRAIN\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM is mentioned as a component of the brain that enables it to store and retrieve learned information.\"\"\",14\n517,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"NEURONAL LEARNING\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM is a component involved in the process of Neuronal Learning.\"\"\",12\n518,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"GENERALIZED ADDITIVE RNNS\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM is a component of the Generalized Additive RNNs architecture that receives axons from other cells.\"\"\",12\n520,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"TMS\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM is mentioned as a factor that biases working memory toward more primacy dominance, which may influence the comparison between the TMS and the IMS.\"\"\",12\n519,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"WM\"\"\",\"\"\"WM also interacts with Long-Term Memory, which stores information for long-term retention and retrieval.\"\"\",11\n492,\"\"\"ROSENBLATT\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"Rosenblatt's work introduced equations to change the weights in a learning model, which are referred to as LTM traces.\"\"\",11\n514,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"HEBB\"\"\",\"\"\"Hebb's learning postulate assumes the wrong processing unit; it is not the strength of an individual connection, but a distributed pattern of LTM traces.\"\"\",10\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.

This theory suggests how a series of Outstars can learn an arbitrary spatiotemporal pattern. Additionally, it has been mentioned that the Outstar Learning Theorem is a specific case of the Generalized Additive Model. This means that the theory can be understood within the broader context of the Generalized Additive Model, and it adds to the understanding of this model by focusing on a specific application.\",4\n345,\"\"\"SPATIAL PATTERN LEARNING\"\"\",\" Spatial Pattern Learning is a concept that encompasses the ability of certain anatomies to learn patterns.

It is a component of the Generalized Additive RNNs architecture, where it sends axons to other cells and learns spatial patterns. Additionally, it is described as a storage mechanism used to store patterns in signals, a type of memory that stores and updates patterns based on input, and a system that can trigger learning and enable fluently recalled information at a future time. STM is also an abbreviation used to refer to Short-Term Memory, a component that stores input patterns persistently and temporarily stores and processes information. In the context of neural learning, STM is a component that interacts with LTM to store partially contrast-enhanced patterns. Overall, STM is a concept that refers to a short-term memory system used for storing and processing information temporarily for immediate use.\",20\n197,\"\"\"BRNN\"\"\",\" \"\"BRNN\"\" is mentioned in the text and is commonly referred to as a Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network.

However, the text also suggests a relationship or connection between the two components of the neural network, as they are mentioned together and interact with each other during Neuronal Learning, allowing the learning of spatial patterns. Additionally, STM includes LTM as a type of memory system, which changes at a slower rate than STM.

It is often mistakenly referred to as the Hopfield network, but it is actually a component of the Liapunov function proposed by Cohen and Grossberg. The Additive Model is also known as a variant of the STM Equation, with specific parameters set to 0. It is primarily used as an approximation of the Shunting Model when inputs are small and do not approach saturation values. Additionally, the Additive Model is a neural network concept mentioned in the text, developed by Grossberg, and it has been used in various computational analyses and research areas. It is also used to explain associative learning of temporal order information in serial learning paradigms. Furthermore, the Additive Model is a probabilistic decision-making model that does not exhibit self-normalization properties, and it is included in the Cohen-Grossberg Model systems. In summary, the Additive Model is a complex mathematical concept with various applications in computational analyses and research, often mistakenly associated with the Hopfield network. It is a model used to approximate the Shunting Model and explain associative learning of temporal order information, and it is also a neural network concept developed by Grossberg.\",17\n81,\"\"\"MAIN TERM\"\"\",\"\"\"The Main Term is a component of the Additive Model, representing the primary term in the equation.\"\"\",1\n82,\"\"\"POSITIVE FEEDBACK TERM\"\"\",\"\"\"The Positive Feedback Term is a component of the Additive Model, representing the influence of positive feedback on the system.\"\"\",1\n83,\"\"\"NEGATIVE FEEDBACK TERM\"\"\",\"\"\"The Negative Feedback Term is a component of the Additive Model, representing the influence of negative feedback on the system.\"\"\",1\n84,\"\"\"INPUT TERM\"\"\",\"\"\"The Input Term is a component of the Additive Model, representing external inputs to the system.\"\"\",1\n89,\"\"\"COMPUTATIONAL VISION\"\"\",\"\"\"Computational Vision is an application area where the Additive Model has been used for analysis and recognition.\"\"\",1\n90,\"\"\"LEARNING\"\"\",\"\"\"Learning is an application area where the Additive Model has been used for analysis and decision-making.\"\"\",1\n91,\"\"\"SPEECH AND LANGUAGE ANALYSIS\"\"\",\"\"\"Speech and Language Analysis is an application area where the Additive Model has been used for analysis of temporal order.\"\"\",1\n92,\"\"\"SENSORY-MOTOR CONTROL\"\"\", Sensory-Motor Control is an application area where the Additive Model has been used for analysis and control.

However, it's important to note that there has been a misnomer in the literature, as the Additive Model has not been accurately referred to as the Hopfield network. Instead, the Hopfield network is a different model developed by John Hopfield, which is characterized by its use of a different approach compared to the Additive Model.

It explains how the brain autonomously learns to categorize, recognize, and predict objects and events in a changing world. The theory is mentioned in the text as a related concept to MTM. ART is a neural network model that focuses on the role of attention in learning and recognition. It was introduced to propose how top-down learned expectations and attentional focusing could dynamically stabilize learning in a Competitive Learning or Self-Organizing Map model. In essence, Adaptive Resonance Theory is a learning model that aims to stabilize learning in response to input patterns by incorporating the role of attention.\",8\n387,\"\"\"BAM\"\"\",\" \"\"BAM\"\" is a type of model that applies to learning laws, such as the passive decay associative law and the signal Hebb law.

It is described as a rule that assumes working memory has a limited capacity, and when new items are stored, activity is redistributed rather than simply added. This principle is also mentioned in relation to RCFs (Regularity, Contiguity, and Frequency), suggesting that it follows from the tendency of these frameworks to normalize total network activity. Additionally, the Normalization Rule is presented as a conservation law that ensures the total activity remains constant by forcing a decrease in other activities when one activity increases. Furthermore, it is characterized as a constraint that ensures stable learning and memory of list chunks, likely through a specialized process. In essence, the Normalization Rule is a principle that ensures the total activity of the working memory network has a maximum capacity, redistributing activity when new items are stored.\",6\n399,\"\"\"LTM INVARIANCE PRINCIPLE\"\"\",\" The LTM Invariance Principle is a postulate that plays a significant role in understanding stable learning and memory of list chunks. According to the descriptions provided, this principle ensures that learning and memory of list chunks remain stable without causing catastrophic forgetting of familiar subset list chunks. Additionally, it is suggested that all working memories are specialized versions of the same underlying network design, further emphasizing its importance in maintaining stable learning and memory.\",3\n228,\"\"\"RCFS\"\"\",\" \"\"RCFs, or Recurrent Cortical Feedbacks, are a type of model or theory that has been studied in various contexts, including the explanation of visual perception and decision-making. They are also mentioned as a network model that behaves like an Item-and-Order working memory model under certain conditions. Additionally, RCFs are likely a type of specialized process potentially related to the Normalization Rule. Despite not having a explicitly defined nature, they are known to refer to recurrent cortical feedbacks, which are studied in the context of cortical models. Furthermore, RCFs, or Recurrent Connections with Feedback, are a type of network that help to store inputs in short-term memory and obey the LTM Invariance Principle.\"\"\n\nThe summary provides a comprehensive description of RCFs, including their role as a model or theory for explaining visual perception and decision-making, their behavior as a network model, their potential relationship to the Normalization Rule, and their role in cortical models and short-term memory storage. The description also clarifies that RCFs are known as recurrent cortical feedbacks.\",5\n227,\"\"\"CORTICAL MODELS\"\"\",\"\"\"Cortical Models are theoretical representations of the brain's cortex, used for studying shunting dynamics.\"\"\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\n475,\"\"\"GROSSBERG\"\"\",\"\"\"NORMALIZATION RULE\"\"\",\"\"\"Grossberg predicted the Normalization Rule to support stable learning and memory of list chunks.\"\"\",75\n474,\"\"\"GROSSBERG\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM INVARIANCE PRINCIPLE\"\"\",\"\"\"Grossberg predicted the LTM Invariance Principle to ensure stable learning and memory of list chunks.\"\"\",72\n643,\"\"\"NORMALIZATION RULE\"\"\",\"\"\"WORKING MEMORY\"\"\",\"\"\"The Normalization Rule is a principle that applies to working memories, ensuring their limited capacity and activity redistribution when new items are stored.\"\"\",15\n652,\"\"\"WORKING MEMORY\"\"\",\"\"\"RCFS\"\"\",\"\"\"RCFs are mentioned as a type of network that can be embodied by specialized recurrent on-center off-surround shunting networks, which are related to the functioning of working memories.\"\"\",14\n642,\"\"\"NORMALIZATION RULE\"\"\",\"\"\"RCFS\"\"\",\" The Normalization Rule and RCFS are both mentioned in the context of network activity.

These principles are predicted to support stable learning and memory of list chunks. The LTM Invariance Principle and the Normalization Rule are two interconnected constraints that Grossberg has proposed to ensure the stability of learning and memory processes.

Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\n57,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\" LTM, or Long-Term Memory, is a crucial component mentioned in the text that plays a significant role in neuronal learning. It interacts with STM (Short-Term Memory) during this process. LTM is also a component of the Generalized Additive RNNs architecture, where it receives axons from other cells and learns spatial patterns. LTM is a type of long-term memory system that changes at a slower rate than STM. It enables information to be fluently recalled at a future time, making it an essential component for long-term retention and retrieval of information. LTM is a theoretical concept that biases working memory toward more primacy dominance. In the context of neural networks, LTM is a component that stores and retrieves information over an extended period, storing learned patterns and activities. Overall, LTM is a versatile and important component in the field of neuronal learning and memory storage.\",9\n433,\"\"\"WM\"\"\",\"\"\"WM refers to Working Memory, a cognitive system that holds information temporarily for immediate use.\"\"\",2\n128,\"\"\"HEBB\"\"\",\" Donald O. Hebb, a renowned neuroscientist, is a person who ascribed the property of monotonely increasing learned weights to his law in the 1940s. He is particularly known for his work on neural networks and learning, making significant contributions to the field.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\n496,\"\"\"STM\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\" \"\"STM\"\" and \"\"LTM\"\" are two components mentioned in the text that are related to each other. LTM traces learn to match the pattern of activities, or STM traces, of cells across the network. Both STM and LTM are mentioned in relation to uncoupled interactions in learning models, suggesting a potential separation between the two types of memory. However, the text also suggests a relationship or connection between the two components of the neural network, as they are mentioned together and interact with each other during Neuronal Learning, allowing the learning of spatial patterns. Additionally, STM includes LTM as a type of memory system, which changes at a slower rate than STM. In summary, STM and LTM are two components of the neural network that have distinct roles and functions, but they also have a relationship or connection with each other, as they interact during learning and STM includes LTM as a type of memory system.\",29\n513,\"\"\"STM\"\"\",\"\"\"WM\"\"\",\"\"\"WM is composed of Short-Term Memory, which stores information temporarily for immediate use.\"\"\",22\n515,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"LEABRA MODEL\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM is a component used in the Leabra model, which stores and retrieves information over an extended period.\"\"\",14\n516,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"THE BRAIN\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM is mentioned as a component of the brain that enables it to store and retrieve learned information.\"\"\",14\n517,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"NEURONAL LEARNING\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM is a component involved in the process of Neuronal Learning.\"\"\",12\n518,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"GENERALIZED ADDITIVE RNNS\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM is a component of the Generalized Additive RNNs architecture that receives axons from other cells.\"\"\",12\n520,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"TMS\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM is mentioned as a factor that biases working memory toward more primacy dominance, which may influence the comparison between the TMS and the IMS.\"\"\",12\n519,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"WM\"\"\",\"\"\"WM also interacts with Long-Term Memory, which stores information for long-term retention and retrieval.\"\"\",11\n492,\"\"\"ROSENBLATT\"\"\",\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"Rosenblatt's work introduced equations to change the weights in a learning model, which are referred to as LTM traces.\"\"\",11\n514,\"\"\"LTM\"\"\",\"\"\"HEBB\"\"\",\"\"\"Hebb's learning postulate assumes the wrong processing unit; it is not the strength of an individual connection, but a distributed pattern of LTM traces.\"\"\",10\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.

This theory suggests how a series of Outstars can learn an arbitrary spatiotemporal pattern. Additionally, it has been mentioned that the Outstar Learning Theorem is a specific case of the Generalized Additive Model. This means that the theory can be understood within the broader context of the Generalized Additive Model, and it adds to the understanding of this model by focusing on a specific application.\",4\n345,\"\"\"SPATIAL PATTERN LEARNING\"\"\",\" Spatial Pattern Learning is a concept that encompasses the ability of certain anatomies to learn patterns. This concept is further described as the process of identifying and learning patterns in spatial data, such as images or signals. In essence, Spatial Pattern Learning involves the recognition and understanding of patterns within spatial information.\",3\n377,\"\"\"SPARSE STABLE CATEGORY LEARNING THEOREM\"\"\",\"\"\"The Sparse Stable Category Learning Theorem is another learning theory proposed by Stanley Grossberg, which occurs using the dual network to the Outstar, namely the Instar.

This learning model involves a competitive process where neurons in a network compete to respond to input patterns. It is a type of unsupervised learning, meaning that there is no external guidance or supervision during the learning process. In this model, neurons compete for the right to respond to input patterns, enhancing their ability to learn and adapt.\",2\n381,\"\"\"SELF-ORGANIZING MAP\"\"\",\" \"\"Self-Organizing Map\"\" is a type of artificial neural network that is designed to learn and represent the structure of input data.

It is a component of the Generalized Additive RNNs architecture, where it sends axons to other cells and learns spatial patterns. Additionally, it is described as a storage mechanism used to store patterns in signals, a type of memory that stores and updates patterns based on input, and a system that can trigger learning and enable fluently recalled information at a future time. STM is also an abbreviation used to refer to Short-Term Memory, a component that stores input patterns persistently and temporarily stores and processes information. In the context of neural learning, STM is a component that interacts with LTM to store partially contrast-enhanced patterns. Overall, STM is a concept that refers to a short-term memory system used for storing and processing information temporarily for immediate use.\",20\n197,\"\"\"BRNN\"\"\",\" \"\"BRNN\"\" is mentioned in the text and is commonly referred to as a Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network.

However, the text also suggests a relationship or connection between the two components of the neural network, as they are mentioned together and interact with each other during Neuronal Learning, allowing the learning of spatial patterns. Additionally, STM includes LTM as a type of memory system, which changes at a slower rate than STM.

It is often mistakenly referred to as the Hopfield network, but it is actually a component of the Liapunov function proposed by Cohen and Grossberg. The Additive Model is also known as a variant of the STM Equation, with specific parameters set to 0. It is primarily used as an approximation of the Shunting Model when inputs are small and do not approach saturation values. Additionally, the Additive Model is a neural network concept mentioned in the text, developed by Grossberg, and it has been used in various computational analyses and research areas. It is also used to explain associative learning of temporal order information in serial learning paradigms. Furthermore, the Additive Model is a probabilistic decision-making model that does not exhibit self-normalization properties, and it is included in the Cohen-Grossberg Model systems. In summary, the Additive Model is a complex mathematical concept with various applications in computational analyses and research, often mistakenly associated with the Hopfield network. It is a model used to approximate the Shunting Model and explain associative learning of temporal order information, and it is also a neural network concept developed by Grossberg.\",17\n81,\"\"\"MAIN TERM\"\"\",\"\"\"The Main Term is a component of the Additive Model, representing the primary term in the equation.\"\"\",1\n82,\"\"\"POSITIVE FEEDBACK TERM\"\"\",\"\"\"The Positive Feedback Term is a component of the Additive Model, representing the influence of positive feedback on the system.\"\"\",1\n83,\"\"\"NEGATIVE FEEDBACK TERM\"\"\",\"\"\"The Negative Feedback Term is a component of the Additive Model, representing the influence of negative feedback on the system.\"\"\",1\n84,\"\"\"INPUT TERM\"\"\",\"\"\"The Input Term is a component of the Additive Model, representing external inputs to the system.\"\"\",1\n89,\"\"\"COMPUTATIONAL VISION\"\"\",\"\"\"Computational Vision is an application area where the Additive Model has been used for analysis and recognition.\"\"\",1\n90,\"\"\"LEARNING\"\"\",\"\"\"Learning is an application area where the Additive Model has been used for analysis and decision-making.\"\"\",1\n91,\"\"\"SPEECH AND LANGUAGE ANALYSIS\"\"\",\"\"\"Speech and Language Analysis is an application area where the Additive Model has been used for analysis of temporal order.\"\"\",1\n92,\"\"\"SENSORY-MOTOR CONTROL\"\"\", Sensory-Motor Control is an application area where the Additive Model has been used for analysis and control.

Instead, the Hopfield network is a different model developed by John Hopfield, which is characterized by its use of a different approach compared to the Additive Model.

It involves assigning a single label to each input sequence, making it a problem where the codomain of a function is a finite set. Additionally, classification is a task that involves categorizing data into distinct classes or categories. This process can be applied to time series patterns, such as identifying a word based on hand movements. In essence, classification is the process of assigning input data to one of several predefined categories or classes.\",9\n864,\"\"\"REGRESSION\"\"\",\" Regression is a statistical technique that is primarily used for approximating a function, specifically a function that operates on the real numbers. Additionally, regression is a predictive modeling technique that involves predicting a continuous value based on input data.

It involves assigning a single label to each input sequence, making it a problem where the codomain of a function is a finite set. Additionally, classification is a task that involves categorizing data into distinct classes or categories. This process can be applied to time series patterns, such as identifying a word based on hand movements. In essence, classification is the process of assigning input data to one of several predefined categories or classes.\",9\n864,\"\"\"REGRESSION\"\"\",\" Regression is a statistical technique that is primarily used for approximating a function, specifically a function that operates on the real numbers.
