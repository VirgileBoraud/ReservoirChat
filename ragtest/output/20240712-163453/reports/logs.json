Secondly, Carpenter is identified as a co-author in a reference related to the recurrent signals in the neural network. This suggests that Carpenter has contributed to research in this area, likely focusing on the application of recurrent signals in neural networks. Overall, Carpenter's role in the text revolves around his contributions to the understanding of catastrophic forgetting and his involvement in research on recurrent signals in neural networks."]}}
