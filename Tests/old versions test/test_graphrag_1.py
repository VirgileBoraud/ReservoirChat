# Load the dataset
X_train, Y_train, X_test, Y_test = japanese_vowels()

# Next, let's create a reservoir and a readout node. In this example, I'll use a Reservoir node with 500 units, a spectral radius of 0.9, and a leak rate of 0.1. The readout node will be a Ridge node with a ridge parameter of 1e-6.

# Create a reservoir node
reservoir = Reservoir(500, sr=0.9, lr=0.1)

# Create a readout node
readout = Ridge(ridge=1e-6)

# Now, let's connect the reservoir and readout nodes to create a simple reservoir computing model:

# Connect the reservoir and readout nodes
model = reservoir >> readout


# Finally, let's train the model and make predictions:

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# Make predictions
Y_pred = model.run(X_test)
