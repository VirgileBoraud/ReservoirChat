        "Question": "What is a recurrent neural network?",
        "Answer": "A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is one of the two broad types of artificial neural networks, characterized by the direction of the flow of information between its layers. Here are the key aspects and characteristics of RNNs: **Bi-directional Flow**: Unlike uni-directional feedforward neural networks, RNNs allow the output from some nodes to affect subsequent input to the same nodes, creating a bi-directional flow of information. **Internal State (Memory)**: RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. This capability makes them suitable for tasks like unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition and speech recognition. **Infinite Impulse Response (IIR)**: The term \"recurrent neural network\" typically refers to networks with an infinite impulse response. These networks are characterized by directed cyclic graphs that cannot be unrolled. **Finite Impulse Response (FIR)**: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) belong to the class of finite impulse response networks. A finite impulse recurrent network is a directed acyclic graph that can be unrolled and replaced with a strictly feedforward neural network. **Gated States**: Additional stored states and controlled storage mechanisms can be added to both IIR and FIR networks. These controlled states, known as gated states or gated memory, are integral to long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs). **Feedback Neural Network (FNN)**: Networks that incorporate time delays or feedback loops, replacing standard storage, are also referred to as Feedback Neural Networks. **Handwriting Recognition**: Processing unsegmented, connected handwriting. **Speech Recognition**: Recognizing and processing spoken language."

    {
        "Question": "What are timeseries?",
        "Answer": "In mathematics, a time series is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order. Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus, it is a sequence of discrete-time data. Examples of time series include: Heights of ocean tides Counts of sunspots Daily closing value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average **Regression Analysis**: Often employed to test relationships between one or more different time series. **Cross-Sectional Studies**: Involve data without a natural ordering of observations (e.g., explaining people's wages by their education levels). **Spatial Data Analysis**: Observations typically relate to geographical locations (e.g., house prices by location). **Temporal Ordering**: Time series data have a natural temporal ordering, distinguishing it from cross-sectional studies. **Stochastic Models**: Reflect the fact that observations close together in time will be more closely related than observations further apart. **Time Reversibility**: Time series models often use the natural one-way ordering of time, expressing values for a given period as deriving from past values, rather than future values. **Real-Valued Continuous Data**: Such as temperature readings over time. **Discrete Numeric Data**: Such as counts of events occurring in fixed intervals. **Discrete Symbolic Data**: Sequences of characters, such as letters and words in a language."

    },
    {
        "Question": "What is regularized ridge regression?",
        "Answer": "Ridge regression is a statistical regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models. Overfitting happens when a model performs well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data. Ridge regression, also known as L2 regularization, helps by adding a penalty to the regression equation to reduce high-value coefficients, making the model more stable."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why does a feedback connection can help tame the reservoir neurons activities?",
        "Answer": "Feedback connections in Reservoir Computing (RC) architectures help stabilize and control the activity of neurons in the reservoir. These connections provide additional information to the neurons, influencing their state and helping to manage the overall dynamics of the network. By incorporating feedback, the reservoir can maintain a balance between sensitivity to input signals and robustness against noise, leading to more reliable and consistent outputs. This mechanism ensures that the network does not become overly chaotic, which is crucial for tasks that require precise temporal information processing."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why don't you need the connections inside the reservoir to be trained?",
        "Answer": "In Reservoir Computing (RC) architectures, the connections inside the reservoir do not need to be trained because the reservoir's purpose is to project input data into a high-dimensional space, capturing the temporal dynamics and non-linear relationships. The reservoir consists of randomly and recurrently connected neurons, and this randomness is sufficient to create a rich set of dynamics. The only part of the network that is trained is the output layer, called the readout, which can effectively learn to map these dynamic representations to the desired output."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is a random high dimensional vector?",
        "Answer": "In the context of Echo State Networks (ESNs), a random high-dimensional vector refers to the activations of the reservoir. These reservoir's neurons receive input signals and, due to their random connections, transform these inputs into high-dimensional representations. This high-dimensional vector captures intricate patterns and dynamics of the input data. These activations are then fed to the readout layer, which is trained to decode them and perform specific tasks. This setup enables efficient learning without training the internal connections of the reservoir."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why is a readout created using a Ridge node?",
        "Answer": "In Echo State Networks (ESNs), a readout is created using a Ridge node (a form of regularized linear regression) because it provides a simple yet effective way to train the output layer. Ridge regression, also known as L2 regularization, helps prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the size of the coefficients. This ensures that the model generalizes well to new data. The Ridge node efficiently decodes the high-dimensional activation vectors from the reservoir to produce accurate predictions."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What does changing the time constant of an ESN do?",
        "Answer": "Changing the time constant in an Echo State Network (ESN) affects how quickly the neurons in the reservoir update their states in response to inputs. This is controlled by the leaking rate parameter. A low leaking rate results in low inertia, meaning the network quickly forgets previous states and has low recall. Conversely, a high leaking rate results in high inertia, allowing the network to better recall previous states and retain more information over time."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the spectral radius?",
        "Answer": "The spectral radius is the largest absolute value of the eigenvalues of the reservoir matrix in an Echo State Network (ESN). It determines the stability and memory capacity of the reservoir. A spectral radius close to 1 helps the reservoir states to be less affected by initial conditions, enhancing the network's ability to memorize past inputs."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What does changing the chaoticity of the reservoir dynamics do?",
        "Answer": "Changing the chaoticity of the reservoir dynamics, influenced by the spectral radius, alters the behavior of the reservoir neurons. A higher spectral radius can lead to more chaotic dynamics, which might improve the network's ability to process complex temporal patterns but can also make it less stable. Conversely, a lower spectral radius results in more stable, less chaotic dynamics, which might be easier to control but could reduce the network's flexibility in capturing intricate patterns."

    {
        "Question": "What is a single timestep of data?",
        "Answer": "A single timestep of data refers to one discrete time point in a sequence of data used for training or evaluating a model. In time series analysis, each timestep represents the value of the variable being measured at that particular moment in time. For example, if you are analyzing hourly temperature data, a single timestep would be the temperature recorded at one specific hour."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What does the X[0] mean in the line: s = reservoir(X[0].reshape(1, -1))?",
        "Answer": "It refers to the first timestep of the input data `X`. This selects the data at the initial time point in the time series. The `reshape(1, -1)` method reshapes this single timestep into a format suitable for processing by the reservoir, ensuring it has the correct dimensions for input. This operation triggers the reservoir neurons based on this single timestep of data, updating the reservoir's state accordingly."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What does the .shape mean in the line: print(\"New state vector shape: \", s.shape)?",
        "Answer": "The `.shape` attribute of `s` returns the dimensions of the array `s`. This tells you the size and structure of the new state vector after processing a single timestep of data. The output helps verify the correct shape and dimensionality of the state vector resulting from the reservoir's activation."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is a null vector?",
        "Answer": "A null vector is a vector in which all elements are zero. In the context of reservoir computing, the internal state of the reservoir is often initialized to a null vector, meaning that all the neurons start with an activation value of zero. This provides a neutral starting point for processing the input data."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What does the .empty do in the line: states = np.empty((len(X), reservoir.output_dim))?",
        "Answer": "The `.empty` function in `states = np.empty((len(X), reservoir.output_dim))` creates a new array of the specified shape and size, but without initializing the entries. This means the array will have random values initially, and it is typically used when you plan to fill the array with data later."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What does the .output_dim do in the line: states = np.empty((len(X), reservoir.output_dim))?",
        "Answer": "The `.output_dim` attribute in the line `states = np.empty((len(X), reservoir.output_dim))` specifies the number of output dimensions of the reservoir. It defines the second dimension of the `states` array, ensuring it matches the output size of the reservoir's neurons."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What does states[:, :20] mean?",
        "Answer": "The notation `states[:, :20]` means selecting all rows in the `states` array and the first 20 columns. This is used to access and visualize the activations of the first 20 neurons across all timesteps in the timeseries."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is a for-loop?",
        "Answer": "A for-loop is a control flow statement in programming used to repeatedly execute a block of code a certain number of times or over a sequence of elements. For example, iterating over elements in a list, array, or range. It is useful for tasks like processing each element in a dataset or performing a series of computations multiple times."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the difference between features and states?",
        "Answer": "Features are attributes or properties associated with an input or sample. For example, in an image, each pixel can be a feature. In a dataset, features are the variables or measurements describing each data point."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the difference between features and inputs?",
        "Answer": "An input usually refers to an example (sometimes also known as sample, observation, or data point) \\( x \\) from a dataset that you pass to the model. For example, in supervised learning, you have a labelled dataset \\( D = \\{ (x_i, y_i) \\}_{i=1}^N \\), where \\( x_i \\) is the \\( i \\)-th input and \\( y_i \\) the corresponding label (also known as target or output). **In image classification**: An image can be an input. **In machine translation**: An input can be a sentence or a word (depending on the model). **In reinforcement learning**: An input can be a state."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is supervised learning?",
        "Answer": "This is when models learn form data that's already been labeled. It's like having an answer key."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is unsupervised learning?",
        "Answer": "This is when models try to find patterns in data that doesn't have labels. It's like solving a puzzle without a picture."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the context manager?",
        "Answer": "A context manager in Python is a construct that allows for setup and cleanup actions around a block of code, using the `with` statement. In the case of the reservoir, the `with_state` context manager temporarily changes the state of the reservoir for operations inside its block. Once the block is exited, the reservoir's state reverts to its original condition. This enables temporary modifications without permanently altering the reservoir's state."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the difference between the 'from_state' and the 'with_state' parameter?",
        "Answer": "In ReservoirPy, they are used to specify the initial state of the reservoir in different contexts: **`from_state`**: This parameter is used to initialize the reservoir with a specific state at the start of a simulation or training process. It sets the state of the reservoir to a given value before any inputs are processed. **`with_state`**: This parameter is used within the context of methods that evolve the state of the reservoir over time. It allows the user to continue the simulation or training process from a specific state, essentially updating the reservoir's state during its operation."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What does calling the reservoir.run(X) really do?",
        "Answer": "Calling `reservoir.run(X)` processes the entire timeseries `X` through the reservoir node, updating the reservoir's state at each timestep based on the input data. It returns the activations of the reservoir neurons for the whole timeseries. This method efficiently gathers the activations without the need for an explicit loop, leveraging the internal dynamics of the reservoir to transform the input data into high-dimensional representations."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is a reccurent network?",
        "Answer": "It is a type of artificial neural network characterized by bi-directional flow of information, allowing outputs from some nodes to affect future inputs to the same nodes. This architecture enables RNNs to use internal state (memory) to process sequences of inputs, making them suitable for tasks like handwriting and speech recognition. RNNs can have infinite impulse response (directed cyclic graphs) or finite impulse response (directed acyclic graphs). Advanced versions like LSTMs and GRUs use gated states for improved memory and control."

    {
        "Question": "What is an artificial neural network?",
        "Answer": "An artificial neural network (ANN) is a machine learning model inspired by biological neural networks in animal brains. It consists of connected units called neurons, which process and transmit signals through connections with adjustable weights. Neurons are organized into layers, including input, hidden, and output layers. ANNs are used for tasks like predictive modeling and adaptive control, learning from data through training methods such as backpropagation to optimize their parameters and minimize prediction errors."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the difference between offline and online readouts?",
        "Answer": "The difference between offline and online readouts lies in their training methods and usage. Offline readouts, such as those trained with linear regression (e.g., Ridge readout), need to be fitted with data before they can be used. This fitting process involves learning the connections from the reservoir to the readout neurons. Online readouts, in contrast, can update their weights continuously as new data arrives, making them suitable for real-time applications where data streams in continuously."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What does being fitted means?",
        "Answer": "Being fitted refers to the process of training a model using data. In the context of a readout, it means learning the appropriate weights or connections from the reservoir to the readout neurons based on the provided data. This process adjusts the model parameters to minimize the error between the predicted outputs and the actual target values, thereby preparing the model for making accurate predictions on new, unseen data."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is a ridge readout?",
        "Answer": "A ridge readout is a type of readout node used in reservoir computing, which utilizes ridge regression (a form of linear regression with L2 regularization) to learn the connections from the reservoir to the readout neurons. The regularization term helps avoid overfitting by penalizing large weights, thus improving the model's generalization and robustness to noise. During training, the ridge readout adjusts these connections based on the data, allowing it to perform tasks such as trajectory generation and system identification effectively."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is overfitting?",
        "Answer": "Overfitting in machine learning occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and irrelevant details. This results in a model that performs well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data, as it fails to generalize. Overfitting is indicated by low error rates on training data and high error rates on test data. It happens when the model is too complex or trains for too long on the sample data, and can be mitigated by setting aside a test set during training, simplifying the model. Using techniques like regularization to prevent the model from fitting the noise in the training data help avoid overfitting."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why does the ridge parameter as to be set to 1e-7?",
        "Answer": "The ridge parameter in the Ridge readout, set to 1e-7, is a regularization term that helps prevent overfitting. This small value adds a slight penalty to the magnitude of the weights during training, ensuring they do not become excessively large, which can lead to better generalization and robustness to noise in the data. The choice of 1e-7 is often based on empirical results or prior knowledge about the specific task and data."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What are the teacher vectors?",
        "Answer": "Teacher vectors are the target outputs used during the training of a machine learning model. In supervised learning, each input example \\( x_i \\) in the training dataset has a corresponding teacher vector \\( y_i \\), which represents the desired output for that input. The model learns by adjusting its parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and these teacher vectors, thereby enabling it to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why do we need to define a training task?",
        "Answer": "Defining a training task is essential because it specifies the objective the model needs to achieve, such as predicting future values or classifying data. It involves providing input-output pairs (training data) that guide the model in learning the relationship between inputs and desired outputs. This process allows the model to adjust its parameters to minimize errors and generalize well to new data, ensuring it performs the intended task accurately."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the difference between a timestep and a timeserie?",
        "Answer": "A timestep refers to a single point in time within a timeseries, representing the data value at that specific moment. A timeseries, on the other hand, is a sequence of data points collected or recorded at successive time intervals. In other words, a timeseries is a collection of multiple timesteps, capturing the evolution of data over time."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why training the readout node as a standalone node is not the recommended way of using it?",
        "Answer": "Training the readout node as a standalone node is not recommended because it does not account for the dynamic interactions between the reservoir and the readout during training. The reservoir's internal state needs time to stabilize and accurately reflect the input data. By training the readout in isolation, you risk suboptimal performance due to the initial transient states of the reservoir not being properly handled, which can lead to less accurate predictions."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why do we need to use the warmup parameter?",
        "Answer": "The warmup parameter is used to discard a specified number of initial timesteps when training the readout. This is necessary because the reservoir's internal state starts from a null value and requires some time to become representative of the input data. By ignoring the initial transient states, the model ensures that only stable and relevant activations are used for training, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why do we need to discard timesteps at the beginning of train_states?",
        "Answer": "We need to discard timesteps at the beginning of `train_states` when  we use the warmup parameter. Discarding these timesteps ensures the model trains on the data that were not discarded by the warmup."

    {
        "Question": "What is a weight in a matrix?",
        "Answer": "A weight in a matrix refers to the individual numerical values that define the strength of connections between nodes (neurons) in a neural network. These weights are adjusted during training to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual target values. Each element in the weight matrix represents the weight of the connection between corresponding neurons in adjacent layers of the network."

        "Question": "What is parallelization?",
        "Answer": "Parallelization is the process of dividing a computational task into smaller sub-tasks that can be executed simultaneously on multiple processors or cores. This approach can significantly speed up processing time, improve performance, and increase efficiency, especially for large and complex tasks such as training neural networks or processing big data. By leveraging multiple processors to perform different parts of the task at the same time, parallelization optimizes resource utilization and reduces the overall time required to complete the task."

    {
        "Question": "Why does most nodes can not receive several inputs at once?",
        "Answer": "Most nodes cannot receive several inputs at once because they are designed to process a single input vector, expecting a specific input shape. Handling multiple inputs simultaneously can complicate the processing and require additional mechanisms to aggregate or concatenate the inputs before they reach the node. To manage multiple inputs, a special Concat node is used to combine them into a single vector, ensuring the receiving node can process the combined input correctly."

        "Question": "Why does a concat node resolve the issue of several inputs at once?",
        "Answer": "A concat node aggregate multiple input vectors into a single concatenated vector. This allows nodes that can only process a single input to handle the combined data without modification. The concat node effectively merges the information from different sources, ensuring that the receiving node can process all relevant data in a unified manner, maintaining the integrity and flow of information through the network."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why does the esn_model have 4 nodes whith the concat node and not 3 ?",
        "Answer": "The `esn_model` has 4 nodes with the concat node instead of 3 because the concat node is an additional node that aggregates the multiple inputs into a single vector before passing it to the readout node. This process creates an extra step in the data flow, resulting in the model comprising the input node, reservoir node, concat node, and readout node."

        "Question": "What is the difference between the line : « esn_model = [data, data >> reservoir] >> readout » and the line : « esn_model = [data, data >> reservoir] >> concatenate >> readout »?",
        "Answer": "The difference between the two lines lies in how they handle the combination of multiple inputs before feeding them to the readout node: `esn_model = [data, data >> reservoir] >> readout`: This syntax implies that the inputs from both `data` and `data >> reservoir` are automatically concatenated and then passed to the `readout` node without explicitly creating a concat node. `esn_model = [data, data >> reservoir] >> concatenate >> readout`: This line explicitly introduces a `concatenate` node to combine the inputs from `data` and `data >> reservoir` before passing the concatenated result to the `readout` node. This makes the concatenation step explicit and may offer more control over the process."

    {
        "Question": "What is a feedback connection?",
        "Answer": "A feedback connection in an Echo State Network (ESN) allows the state of one node to influence another node with a one-timestep delay. This is established using the `<<` or `<<=` operators in ReservoirPy. Feedback connections enable the receiver node to access the sender's state, enhancing the dynamic capabilities of the network by incorporating past activations into current processing. This is useful for tasks requiring memory of previous states, such as sequence prediction or temporal pattern recognition."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the purpose of a feedback connection? Some concrete application?",
        "Answer": "The purpose of a feedback connection in an Echo State Network (ESN) is to allow the state of one node (e.g., the readout) to influence another node (e.g., the reservoir) with a one-timestep delay. This enhances the network's ability to remember and utilize past information for current processing. Concrete applications include: **Time series forecasting:** Using previous predictions to improve future forecasts. **Speech recognition:** Incorporating previous phoneme activations to better predict subsequent phonemes. **Control systems:** Using past control signals to adjust future control actions for better system stability."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the difference between the '>>' operator, the '<<' operator and the '<<=' operator?",
        "Answer": "The difference are: **`>>` Operator:** This operator is used to chain connections between nodes in sequence. For example, `reservoir >> readout` connects the reservoir's output to the readout's input. **`<<` Operator:** This operator creates a feedback connection, where the receiver node (left side) can access the state of the sender node (right side) with a one-timestep delay. It creates a copy of the receiver holding a reference to the sender. **`<<=` Operator:** This in-place operator also establishes a feedback connection but without creating a copy of the receiver node. The receiver node directly holds the reference to the sender node's state."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why does having acces to the readout's last activation important?",
        "Answer": "Having access to the readout's last activation is important because it allows the reservoir to use the most recent output information for current processing. This feedback mechanism helps the network to remember and incorporate past decisions or predictions, which is crucial for tasks requiring temporal dependencies and continuity, such as time series forecasting, speech recognition, and control systems. By leveraging previous outputs, the network can improve its accuracy and performance in predicting future states or making informed decisions."

        "Answer": "There is no difference between the `.feedback()` and the `.state()` methods in this context because the feedback mechanism is designed to provide the reservoir with the most recent state of the readout. Here, the `reservoir.feedback()` method returns the last activation of the readout, which is the same as the current state obtained using `readout.state()`. Both methods reflect the same value because the feedback loop directly links the readout's state to the reservoir's input."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is a forced feedback?",
        "Answer": "Forced feedback is a technique used in training Echo State Networks (ESNs) to ensure convergence by providing teacher vectors as feedback to the reservoir during training. This means that the actual target values (teacher vectors) are used as feedback instead of the network's predicted values. This can be specified using the `force_teachers` parameter in the `Model.fit()` method. Forced feedback helps the network learn more effectively by stabilizing the training process, especially when dealing with temporal dependencies."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the difference between forced feedbacks and feedback connections?",
        "Answer": "Forced feedbacks involve using teacher vectors (actual target values) as feedback during the training phase to ensure convergence and stability. This method helps the network learn by providing the correct outputs as feedback instead of its predictions."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is teacher forcing?",
        "Answer": "Teacher forcing is a training technique used in sequence modeling where the true output values (targets) are fed as inputs to the network during training, rather than the network's own predictions. This approach helps the network learn the correct sequence of outputs, especially in scenarios involving recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or echo state networks (ESNs)."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is a convergence?",
        "Answer": "Convergence in the context of machine learning refers to the process where the training algorithm iteratively adjusts the model's parameters until the model reaches a stable state with minimal error. This means the model's performance, as measured by a loss function, stops improving significantly with further training. Convergence indicates that the model has effectively learned the patterns in the training data and is ready to generalize to new, unseen data."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What does the forced_feedback parameter do?",
        "Answer": "The `forced_feedback` parameter in the `Model.run()` method provides an external feedback timeseries to the receiver node when feedback senders like readouts are not available during runtime. This replaces the missing feedback signal, ensuring the receiver node has the necessary information to process the input correctly. The `forced_feedback` parameter helps maintain the network's functionality when direct feedback connections are not feasible or available."

    {
        "Question": "What does the shift_fb=True parameter do in the line : « pred = esn_model.run(X_train, forced_feedbacks=Y_train, shift_fb=True) »?",
        "Answer": "The `shift_fb=True` parameter ensures that the forced feedback timeseries (`Y_train`) is shifted by one timestep relative to the input timeseries (`X_train`). This is necessary because feedback values represent past outputs that should influence future inputs. By shifting the feedback by one timestep, the model receives the correct temporal alignment, ensuring that each input at time `t` is influenced by the output from time `t-1`."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What does the with_feedback() context manager do in the line : « with reservoir.with_feedback(random_feedback): »?",
        "Answer": "The `with_feedback()` context manager temporarily changes the feedback received by the reservoir to the specified `random_feedback`. This allows you to test or manipulate the reservoir's behavior with different feedback signals. Once the context manager block is exited, the feedback reverts to its original state. This mechanism is useful for experimenting with different feedback scenarios without permanently altering the network's configuration."

This last state is then reshaped into the correct input format for the ESN. By using the last state as the starting point, the ESN can accurately continue generating the next steps in the timeseries, ensuring that the initial conditions for prediction are representative of the most recent data."

They can also predict probabilities, such as the probability that an image contains a cat. A probability-predicting regression model can be used as part of a classifier by imposing a decision rule - for example, if the probability is 50% or more, decide it's a cat."

        "Question": "What is the cepstral domain?",
        "Answer": "It's a representation of a signal that results from taking the inverse Fourier transform of the logarithm of the signal's spectrum. This transformation highlights periodic structures in the frequency domain. The cepstral domain separates the source and filter characteristics of a signal, which can be beneficial for tasks such as pitch detection."

        "Question": "What is transduction or sequence-to-sequence encoding?",
        "Answer": "As ReservoirPy Nodes are built to work on sequences, the simplest setup to solve this task is *sequence-to-sequence encoding*, also called *transduction*. A model is trained on encoding each vector of input sequence into a new vector in the output space. Thus, a sequence of audio yields a sequence of label, one label per timestep."

    {
        "Question": "What is Classification or sequence-to-vector model?",
        "Answer": "It's a more elaborated model than the transduction where inference is performed only once on the whole input sequence. Indeed, we only need to assign one label to each input sequence. This new setup is known as a *sequence-to-vector* model, and this is usually the type of model we refer to when talking about classification of sequential patterns."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why does for the transduction we use : « model = [source >> reservoir, source] >> readout » and for the classification we use « model = source >> reservoir >> readout »?",
        "Answer": "In transduction (sequence-to-sequence model), `model = [source >> reservoir, source] >> readout` is used to create a model that considers the sequence of input data and generates a sequence of output labels. This setup ensures each timestep of input has a corresponding label. For classification (sequence-to-vector model), `model = source >> reservoir >> readout` is used to create a model that processes the entire sequence and produces a single output label, which is more suitable for tasks where a single prediction is required for the entire input sequence."

        "Question": "Why is grid search considered suboptimal for hyperparameter tuning in Reservoir Computing?",
        "Answer": "Grid search is considered suboptimal because it allocates too many trials to unimportant hyperparameters and suffers from poor coverage in important dimensions. Random search, in contrast, samples more efficiently and does not waste evaluations on dimensions that do not significantly impact performance​​."

    {
        "Question": "What is the Echo State Property (ESP) and why should it not be strictly adhered?",
        "Answer": "The Echo State Property (ESP) states that the spectral radius should be less than 1 to ensure a contracting system without inputs. However, this condition is primarily theoretical and interpolated from linear systems. In practice, with non-linear reservoirs (e.g., using tanh activation), the optimal spectral radius for some tasks can be greater than 1. Thus, ESP should be viewed as a rough guide rather than a strict rule​​."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What are the key hyperparameters in Reservoir Computing that should be focused on according to the paper?",
        "Answer": "The key hyperparameters to focus on are the spectral radius (SR), input scaling (IS), leaking rate (LR), number of units in the reservoir, and feedback scaling (if feedback from readout units to the reservoir is used). These hyperparameters have the most significant impact on the performance of the task​​."

    {
        "Question": "What is the the general method for hyperparameter exploration?",
        "Answer": "The general method for hyperparameter exploration includes: Setting a minimal reservoir size. Fixing one of the key hyperparameters (IS, SR, or LR). Conducting a first random search with a wide range of values for all hyperparameters. Narrowing the ranges based on the best x% of values and conducting a second random search. Choosing median or best values based on the loss vs. hyperparameter cloud shape. Optionally checking the robustness of fixed hyperparameters and exploring the trade-off between loss and computation time by varying reservoir size. Evaluating the test set on chosen hyperparameters for multiple reservoir instances​​."

    {
        "Question": "How can we handle the interdependencies between hyperparameters during the search?",
        "Answer": "We can use hyperparameter interdependency plots to visually evaluate the loss as a function of all explored hyperparameters and their interactions. This approach helps in understanding and managing the interdependencies between hyperparameters effectively during the search​​. Some titles are with underscore, and others with dashes : 5-Classification-with-RC / 6-Interfacing_with_scikit-learn In the chapter 5: use case in the wild: canary song decoding, I have the impression that the code is not really adapted to the downlable content on Zenodo. It is hovewer perfect when we clone the git. There was also no .png on Zenodo. The name for example doesn't seems to fit but seems to be generic instead."
